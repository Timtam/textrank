Citation Analysis and Discourse Analysis Revisited
HOWARD D. WHITE
Drexel University, Philadelphia John Swales's 1986 article `Citation analysis and discourse analysis' was written by a discourse analyst to introduce citation research from other ®elds, mainly sociology of science, to his own discipline. Here, I introduce applied linguists and discourse analysts to citation studies from information science, a complementary tradition not emphasized by Swales. Using replicable bibliometric techniques, I show that interdisciplinary ties have grown among citation researchers from discourse analysis, sociology of science, and information science in the years since Swales wrote. Key authors, journals, articles, and books are presented in tables based on cocitation data from the Institute for Scienti®c Information. While theoretical integration of the dierent strands of research is far from complete, this article carries the eort forward by reviewing contributions from the 1970s to the present in three major lines of research: citation classi®cation, content analysis of citation contexts, and studies of citer motivations. I pay particular attention to ideas that bear on teaching the art of citingÐfor example, in courses in English for research purposesÐand to controversies in citation research of interest to discourse analysts.

INTRODUCTION
Applied linguists analyse citers' practices to show empirical dierences in disciplinary rhetoric (Hyland 2000, 2001) and to help teachers of English for research purposes (ERP) teach citation in advanced writing courses (Swales and Feak 2000). Sociologists of science analyse citers' practices because they bear on the social construction of knowledge (Law and Williams 1982; Gilbert and Mulkay 1984) or on norms and strati®cation in disciplines that generate literatures (Baldi 1998; Hargens 2000). Both ®elds have used citation data to trace the evolution of scienti®c and scholarly ideas (Pickering and Nadel 1987; Bazerman 1988; Allen et al. 1994; Valle 1999; Salager-Meyer 1999). Given their complementary strengths, it would seem that both ®elds might combine to develop a comprehensive theory of citing. Instead, in `Citation analysis and discourse analysis,' Swales (1986) found that they seemed largely ignorant of each other's work: the citation analysts in sociology of science did not use the studies of citers' rhetorical choices from applied linguistics, and the discourse analysts in applied linguistics did not use the quantitative studies of citation functions by various social and information scientists. He therefore urged `some coming together' of the two ®elds more than 15 year ago. What has happened since?

CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

The interdisciplinary linkages Swales hoped for, though still not strong, are growing. That will be documented here with a technique from citation analysis itself. But as Table 1 shows, there are actually three ®elds involved. Writing to introduce discourse analysts to work outside the ERP tradition, Swales used `sociology of science' to cover both social scientists and information scientists. Yet citation analysis is a much larger and more variegated enterprise in information science than it is in applied linguistics or sociology of science, and it embodies a research tradition quite distinct from the constructivist studies of scienti®c discourse that readers may associate with the latter.

Bibliometrics Information retrieval Information needs and uses

Building on Swales (1986), I will here introduce some citation analyses from information science that may interest readers with ERP backgrounds. They exemplify three ways in which information scientists have classi®ed citationsÐby categorizing relations between the citing and the cited work, by noting topics of the sentences in which citations are embedded, and by inferring or asking the motives of citers. All bear on citing as a rhetorical act, and all are dierent from the syntactical characterizations of citations in ERP. Among other things, I will show a range of textual functions for citations and an alternative view of citer motivations to that presented in some rhetorical work. At certain points in the paper, such as in the comments on negative and perfunctory citations, some standard criticisms of citation analysis are addressed, since they involve issues relevant to discourse analysis and not just to the ®eld of information science. My discussion will also present readers some new analytical techniques, including a way of automatic analysis linked to concordancing, on the assumption that information science is not a ®eld they monitor. Information scientists analyse and evaluate the systems that allow people to ®nd answers or satisfy interests in large bodies of writings, such as library collections, scholarly literatures, and sectors of the World Wide Web. Such systems connect users with relevant writings through a variety of indexes, including the citation indexes of the Institute for Scienti®c Information (ISI), which are currently found online in libraries as the Web of Science. Citations

mark intellectual linkages in academic and professional disciplines and support document retrieval in ways complementary to standard subject indexing (White and McCain 1989, 1997). Hence, information scientists have made citation patterns a major topic of research since the 1960s (cf. Gar®eld 1979; Cronin 1984; Liu 1993). The sub®eld of information science to which citation analysis belongs is most often called bibliometrics (some now prefer scientometrics or informetrics)Ðthe quantitative study of writings in the aggregate. Many studies from the bibliometric tradition are relevant to applied linguists and discourse analysts, especially those who teach citation practices. For example, I will describe some valuable work by Henry Small that was not mentioned in Swales (1986) and remains unused by ERP discourse analysts currently identi®ed with citation studies, such as Hyland (1999, 2000, 2003); Hemais (2001); and Thompson and Tribble (2001). (It is touched on in Bazerman 1988; Swales 1988; Berkenkotter and Huckin 1993; Rose 1996; Salager-Meyer 1999.) Small directs research at ISI in Philadelphia, and he is a founder of cocitation analysis, one variety of which I will demonstrate here. To be fair, I should add that he and many other information scientists do not cite and seem to be unaware of the citation analysts in applied linguistics. In Liu's (1993) otherwise inclusive review of citation studies in information science (and other ®elds), works from applied linguistics are not represented. In some measure, the gap noted in Swales (1986) persists.

AN AUTHOR COCITATION ANALYSIS
It is quite common for two or more ®elds to pursue connectible research goals without knowing ofÐor at least without acknowledgingÐeach other's existence. Typically, they are discourse communities islanded by dierent vocabularies, dierent journals and conferences, dierent bases in academe. The degree of contact between them can be shown empirically through bibliometric techniques from information scienceÐspeci®cally through analyses of author intercitation or cocitation in the databases of ISI. My purpose in this section is to lay out the relations between citation analysis and discourse analysis (or between information science and applied linguistics) and to exemplify some of the analytical tools being discussed. Swales connected the two ®elds by showing how citations in a textbook familiar to readers in ERP could be categorized with a scheme from information science. My bibliometric approach, while very dierent, casts a wider net. To analyse intercitation, one takes a group of representative authors from each ®eld and ®nds how often any member of one group cites any member of the other. For example, how often does Swales from linguistics cite Small from information science and vice-versa? The researcher counts occurrences of the sort Small ! Swales or Swales ! Small, where the arrow represents one or more citations. The second technique, author cocitation analysis, is more inclusive. After

92

CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

pairing members from each of the groups, one ®nds how often the pairs are cited together by all publishing writers. For example, how often does anyone in any discipline cite any work by Swales with any work by Small in the same document? The researcher counts occurrences of the sort Later document ! Small and Swales; every later document that meets the criterion increases the Small±Swales count by one. (Such documents could be written by Small or Swales, but would most often be written by others.) Again, groups that are wholly disconnected have no cocitation ties; no one has joined works by their authors in the references of a later publication. When such ties do exist, information scientists can use them to map ®elds in terms of their most highly cocited authors (White 1990; White and McCain 1998). The author cocitation record shows that the two outer ®elds in Table 1, applied linguistics and information science, are not wholly disconnected. In a small-scale probe of their ties in May 2003, I took six authors who have written about citation practicesÐCharles Bazerman, Greg Myers, and John Swales from applied linguistics/discourse analysis and Belver Grith, Henry Small, and myself from information scienceÐand retrieved our cocitation counts from the merged ®les of two ISI databases on Dialog: Social Scisearch (1972± ) and Arts and Humanities Search (1980± ). The counts for each of the 15 possible author-pairs are shown in Table 2. They will help convey some of what has happened since Swales (1986).

Table 2: Author cocitation counts for three discourse analysts and three information scientists
Myers Bazerman Myers Swales Grith Small 173 Swales 130 107 Grith 11 4 2 Small 25 12 10 157 White 9 4 5 57 135

It should be understood that Dialog counts the articles (or other items in journals) that cite the pairs; it does not count the references to each that are in the articles. Table 2 shows at top left, for example, that 173 articles cite at least one thing by Bazerman and at least one thing by Myers; any given item could cite more. (Duplicate citing documents from the two ISI databases have been removed.) The boxed cocitation counts in Table 2 are those that unite one of the discourse analysts with one of the information scientists. They come from a total of 43 articles (three of them exclusively bibliographic). For example, 11 of the 43 cocite Bazerman and Grith, and 12 cocite Small and Myers. (The

HOWARD D. WHITE

same article could cite more than one author from either trio.) The crossdisciplinary counts inside the box are much lower than the disciplinary ones outside it, but they are not zero: applied linguistics and information science are being connected by cocitation at modest levels. For example, one of the 43 documents, Paul (2000), carries out a citation analysis in the rhetorical tradition with ideas from discourse analysis (Bazerman 1988; Myers 1990), sociology of science (Cozzens 1989), and information science (Small 1978; McCain and Turner 1989). Were my literature search extended, additional cocited authors would be revealed, although again the levels would probably be modest to low. The 43 documents were published from 1984 to 2003. Only ®ve of them existed when Swales (1986) appeared, and so there has been an increase of roughly two articles per year since he wrote. Excluding the bibliographies, they are shown in Table 3: 21 from information science, 11 from history and sociology of science, and 8 from applied linguisticsÐa nice variety of origin. Each journal in the table is preceded by the number of articles it contributed (multiple contributions are listed in order of recency). The Gar®eld Festschrift, a book honoring the founder of ISI, is an exception to the company's rule of covering only journals as sources of citations. Authors who have contributed two or more articles to Table 3 include Cronin, Hjorland, Leydesdor, and È White from information science, Hargens and Baldi from sociology of science, and Bazerman from discourse analysis. The articles in Table 3 do not necessarily connect the ideas of the cited authors in intellectually interesting ways. For instance, Grith and Bazerman or Small and Myers could be cited in the same article but in wholly dierent contexts. The citations to them could also be dispensable as far as the citer's main argument is concerned. I would simply note that, whenever authors are recurrently cocited, there is a good chance that certain ideas from their ®elds are coalescing, with their works as contributing factors. After all, since most authors are never cocited, recurrent cocitation is a signal that something interpretable is happening. A strong recent indicator of coalescence is Hyland (2003), an article that relates self-citation to the larger rhetorical functions of self-mention in scholarly writing. Hyland, well known in ERP, published this `crossover' piece in the main journal of information science. He writes (p. 251): `While sociolinguistic approaches have not played a major role in information science, detailed study of writers' linguistic choices can reveal important aspects of knowledge making and the patterns which characterize disciplinary relationships.' This sets a context wherein work by discourse analysts such as himself and Bazerman can be newly integrated with evidence from information scientists like White (2001) and Cronin and Shaw (2002), who argue the `blamelessness' of self-citation on the basis of empirical data (see also Tagliacozzo 1977; Bonzi and Snyder 1991; Dimitro and Arlitsch 1995). Where the ®elds are coming together can be suggested in richer detail by listing the works that are most frequently cited by the articles in Table 3. This

volume number and initial page. Chapters in collections have their initial page listed after the book title. Counts for dierent editions of the same book have been combined. Where possible, I have spelled out ISI abbreviations, made author name-forms consistent, and added second authors. One or two cryptic name-forms for monographs have been replaced. Despite the absence of article titles (a characteristic of ISI cited-reference downloads), Table 4 is a good ®rst cut at establishing the core literature of citation analysis within the three ®elds of Table 1. Chronologically, the works span more than three decades, from Derek Price's seminal works to various syntheses of the late 1990s. The three ®elds of this article are represented by the top works in Table 4: applied linguistics/discourse analysis by Bazerman's (1988) Shaping Written Knowledge, information science by Small's (1978) article on citations as concept symbols (discussed below), and history and sociology of science by Latour and Woolgar's Laboratory Life. Most authors on the list can be readily identi®ed with one of these ®elds, and some, such as Price, with two. The 97 speci®c works seen in the table are often multivalent in topical relevance; it seems ®tting that one of them is Julie Klein's Interdisciplinarity. As a guide to interpreting journal titles, information science is represented by Scientometrics, JASIS, ARIST, American Documentation, Library Trends, Libri, Knowledge Organization, and Journal of Documentation. History and sociology of science are represented by Social Studies of Science (formerly Science Studies), American Sociological Review, Minerva, History of Science, Social Science Information, Philosophy of the Social Sciences, American Sociologist, and Sociology of Education. Discourse analysis is represented by Applied Linguistics and Written Communication. Science and Research Policy are transdisciplinary. It is clear, especially when the article titles and abstracts are retrieved in full, that the three ®elds are all oriented to the analysis of citations from scienti®c literatures; the literatures of the social sciences and humanities are much less in evidence. The journals contributing by far the most articles are Scientometrics with 15 items and Social Studies of Science (or Science Studies) with 14. In addition to journals, some 36 books are listed, 15 of them published before 1980. (Note that 21 of the cited articles in Table 4 also appeared before 1980.) Foundational books, such as Hagstrom's (1965) The Scienti®c Community or Crane's (1972) Invisible Colleges, remain important. Citation analysis, as seen here, apparently lacks a tendency to cite its most recent publications in a fastmoving research front. This makes it resemble a specialty in the softer social sciences. Authors cited for at least three dierent works in Table 4 are Henry Small (5 works), Charles Bazerman (4) Derek Price (4), Jonathan and Stephen Cole (3 each), Susan Cozzens (3), Michael and Barbara MacRoberts (3 each), John Swales (3), and Howard White (3). Those cited for two dierent works are Terrence Brooks, Blaise Cronin, Nigel Gilbert, Belver Grith, Warren Hagstrom, Birger Hjorland, John Irvine, Bruno Latour, Katherine McCain, È Greg Myers, Michael Moravcsik, Michael Mulkay, and Harriet Zuckerman. It

will be seen that applied linguistics furnishes fewer names than sociology of science or information science. There is a bit of self-citation going onÐfor example, some of the authors just listed also authored some of the citing items in Table 3. However, these are among the very works that are connecting the dierent research traditions of citation analysis, and they cannot reasonably be left out. I would also point out that most of the names and works in Table 4 are not the result of selfcitation, but rather of inherent cohesion in the literature I am sampling. That cohesion is both quantitative:
. 97 items are each cited at least three times by only 43 documents; . the top three items are each cited by almost half the documents;

and qualitative:
. domain experts would recognize many items on the list and ®nd their presence interpretable; . both the Mertonian and the constructivist schools of science studies are well represented; . the list itself could be the bibliography of a literature review of citation analysis as seen from applied linguistics, history and sociology of science, and information science.

THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
With this as background, I turn to brief examinations of developments before and since Swales (1986), focusing on writings by information scientists (or by bibliometrically inclined sociologists) that are relevant to readers in ERP. Broad reviews of the citation analysis literature by information scientists include Smith (1981), Cronin (1984), Pierce (1987), and Baird and Oppenheim (1994). One in particular, Liu (1993), is valuable for its wide coverage. Two empirical articles, McCain and Turner (1989) and Case and Higgins (2000), contain informative mini-reviews. But the piece that should be in every discourse analyst's ®les for its synthesizing power is Small (1982). Small distinguishes two ways of analysing citations on the basis of the text immediately around them. Both have produced streams of research. The ®rst is to classify abstract features of the relationship between citing and cited work, such as whether the cited work seems essential or inessential to the argument of the citing work and whether the citer's attitude seems positive or negative. The second is to read citations as indicators of concrete topics, as if they stood for subject headings. Generally the ®rst requires the analyst to judge and code some aspect of the citation that is only implicit in the context, while in the second the analyst makes use of explicit words or phrases connected with the citation. The ®rst thus depends relatively heavily on the analyst's expertise; the second, on the text in which the citation occurs. Both are forms of citation context analysis,

100 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

but the second is sometimes called citation content analysis (McCain and Turner 1989) or `content analyses of citation contexts' (Small 1982: 301). (`Context' here always means `co-occurring text' rather than the entire situation of communication.) A third stream of research not mentioned in Small (1982) involves discovering citer motivations (including their motives for self-citation and for non-citation of certain items). Examples of the three approaches will be taken up in turn. They are covered in greater detail by Brooks (1988) and Liu (1993), who also list in full the categories of the analytical schemes they discuss.

CLASSIFYING CITATIONS
The ®rst approach involves what Small (1982) calls citation classi®cation schemes. All are attempts to understand what people are doing when they cite. Over the years, about 20 have appeared from dierent disciplines with little regard for coordination; Baldi (1998) gently mocks them as `a cottage industry'. Swales (1986), which discusses several, drew on the categories of perhaps the best known, Moravcsik and Murugesan (1975), to characterize 74 citations to the book Communicative Syllabus Design by John Munby. These categories are conceptual vs. operational, organic vs. perfunctory, evolutionary vs. juxtapositional, and con®rmational vs. negative (de®nitions below). Swales ended up dropping the conceptual/operational dichotomy as inappropriate outside science (Moravcsik and Murugesan had coded citations from papers in high energy physics) and modifying the organic/perfunctory dichotomy to extensive vs. short, which is easier to code (cf. McCain and Turner 1989, who used central vs. peripheral). In truth, the citation classi®cation schemes are all idiosyncratic and hard to code, which means that replications of their use across literatures are scarce (Cano 1989 and Hooten 1991 are among the few). However, insofar as their categories can be matched, Small (1982) does so for eight of the schemes, all from the 1970s. He thus presents an integrative view of some of the major functions of citation. It turns out that, although each scheme has its unique nuances, there is a great deal of commonality underlying their dierent categories. Better still, Small was able to compare the percentages of citations falling into the matched categories across seven of the schemes, thereby turning what had been independent studies into rough replications. His results are important to ERP because they address the complaint, recurrent in academe, that evaluations based on citation counts (such as those in Table 4) are distorted by negative citations and perfunctory citations that analysts do not properly take into account. Thus, Small's most notable ®nding is that in all studies the proportion of negative or refutational citations (i.e. those in which the citer criticizes or attempts to overturn the citee's work) is relatively low: from one to 14 percent, by subjective coding. This contradicts the folk-theory that high citation counts cannot be trusted as indicators of quality or impact because

HOWARD D. WHITE

they are in¯ated with negative citations. (Doubts like this motivated Moravcsik and Murugesan and have often been voiced by critics of citation analysis.) More recent studies reviewed in Vinkler (1998) and Case and Higgins (2000) continued to report low percentages of negative citation. The ®gure of 14 percent in Moravcsik and Murugesan seems to be the highest anyone has found. The great majority of citations are thus con®rmative; the citing work in some measure agrees with the cited work in its ®ndings or judgements. I should add that negative citations do not necessarily indicate worthlessness; they often simply show controversy. The negative citers may themselves be wrong and the citees right. In any case, it is something of an achievement to have one's work noticed by others, even if negatively; work deemed substandard or negligible is seldom cited at all (cf. Cole and Cole 1971; Myers 1990: 101; White 2001). It is much more common for a work to go uncited than to be negatively cited, and that accounts for the low percentages in the latter category. In contrast, MacRoberts and MacRoberts (1984) argued that the percentages are low because citers dissemble, hiding their negative feelings behind positive or neutral words. Given the critical mindset ingrained in science and scholarship, citers must often be ambivalent toward what they cite, as Brooks (1986) indeed found. But it is not at all clear how one can know that words like `classic' or `important' in reference to papers really mean `misconceived' or `spurious,' as, without giving evidence, the MacRobertses claim. They further claim that, when citers combine negative with positive remarks in a single citation, their real attitude is negative (the positive remarks are there simply for political reasons). Teufel (1999: 90±1) gives this argument a rhetorical twist by observing that, in her examples, the positive expressions always precede the negative, `suggesting that the real intention was to criticize'. But this does not devalue the positive comments entirely; the logic of Creating a Research Space, to use Swales's (1990) phrase, makes it hard to avoid quali®ed praise of the `Good . . . however . . . ' sort. I take an example from Teufel (italics hers): `Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Huang et al. 1990) oer a powerful statistical approach to this problem, though it is unclear how they could be used to recognise the units of interest to phonologists.' While one might call this judgement mildly negative, note that it does not correct an erroneous paper by Huang et al. in whole or in part, which are Chubin and Moitra's (1975) criteria for calling a citation negative; nor does it re¯ect a situation in which the citer is `not certain about the correctness of the citing paper', which is the criterion in Murugesan and Moravcsik (1978: 142). Cases like the famous overturn of Fleischmann and Pons's research on cold fusion do not typify negative citation in most ®elds most of the time. As Swales (1986) suggested, echoing Peritz (1983a), it is often quite hard to decide whether a citation is negative. The coding of `negativity' in some studies may have con¯ated real attacks and refutations with mere assertions

102 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

that the citee's work has not solved the problem the citer wants to address. Cronin (1994) observed, moreover, that a citation can refer to the citee's work at dierent levels of granularity (to an entire oeuvre, a cross-textual motif, a document, a passage, a single sentence, a phrase, a number); any one of these levels can be criticized, and existing schemes do not take this adequately into account. Small's (1982) results reveal that perfunctory citation (Moravcsik and Murugesan's term for references not really necessary to the citing paper) is indeed quite common, ranging from 20 to 60 percent across the seven studies, again by subjective coding. Perfunctory citation, so-called, should not be dismissed as unimportant, however; it ties many new works to their discourse communities and, universally, holds literatures together (cf. the account of `orienting reference lists' in Hargens 2000). Its opposite (in Moravcsik and Murugesan) is organic citation, meaning that the new work can be fully understood only in terms of some earlier work it cites. The organic tie is unfortunately close to another of Moravcsik and Murugesan's categories, evolutionary citation, meaning that the citing work grows out of the cited work rather than being an alternative to it; examples of the latter they call juxtapositional citations. Moravcsik and Murugesan apply their four sets of opposite categories jointly; thus, a single citation could be characterized as, for example, operational, organic, evolutionary, and con®rmative all at once. A revisionist follow-up, Chubin and Moitra (1975), made Moravcsik and Murugesan's categories mutually exclusive (with plainer names) and refashioned them into a kind of scale. In a move deplored as confusing by Murugesan and Moravcsik (1978), Chubin and Moitra also changed the meaning of perfunctory from `dispensable' to `cited without additional comment', probably to make coding easier. The similar simpli®cations of Swales (1986), McCain and Turner (1989), and White (2001) arise from the conviction that, when large numbers of citations are involved, Moravcsik and Murugesan's original categories are too hard to work with. No citation classi®cation scheme in fact is likely to win wide acceptance unless assignments to it can be automated, and that lets out most of the schemes to date. Deciding whether a citation is integral in the ERP tradition looks super®cially like one of Moravcsik and Murugesan's or Chubin and Moitra's judgement tasks, but in fact it is much easier to do, because the criterion is explicitly syntactical. The integral citation is syntactically part of the sentenceÐfor example, it governs the verb in a sentence like `Nobody (1996) urged that . . .'. The nonintegral citation is a parenthetical expression, as in `It has been urged (Nobody 1996) that . . .'. Further re®nements are possible, again based on syntactical criteria. This type of citation categorization received its impetus from Swales (1990) and continues in works such as Hawes and Thomas (1997), Hyland (1999), Hemais (2001), and Thompson and Tribble (2001). It can be applied in any literature, because analysts need only grammatical, not subject-matter expertise to do the coding. In contrast,

HOWARD D. WHITE

103

Moravcsik, who was trained as a physicist, needed his domain knowledge to code his sample of citations from high-energy physics; deciding whether a citation is, say, organic requires very dierent knowledge from deciding whether it is integral, in the ERP sense. The citation classi®cation schemes in Small (1982) and their later counterparts all require close reading, domain knowledge, and expert judgement to apply (cf. McCain and Turner 1989). Insofar as they require the recovery of implicit meaning, it may be that their application cannot be delegated to a computer even in principle, an outcome that does not hold for schemes that require only syntactical parsing. (A computer could parse the sentences referring to the MacRoberts article above, but how would one program it to recognize that the citation is, say, juxtapositional and negative?) I thus note an ironic role reversal. By concentrating on matters of syntax, the English teachers in the ERP tradition are thinking formally, like programmers, while the information scientists who ponder shades of meaning in the citation classi®cation tradition are thinking hermeneutically, like literary critics. Of course, the payo for the hermeneutic thinking is correspondingly greater. It is relatively easy to teach students permissible forms of syntax for citing; relatively hard to get them to feel the underlying logic in their bones.

CONTENT ANALYSES OF CITATION CONTEXTS
There is a more promising line of analysis in information science than the labour-intensive classi®cation of implicit citation features just described. That is interpretation of explicit words in citation contexts as detected by computer (or very patient human beings). It has been known for many years that the distinctive format of references like `Nobody (1996)' marks contexts for recognition. For example, O'Conner (1982) proposed that noun phrases from these contexts be automatically gathered as additional subject indexing for the cited work. The size of the recognition window may range from a few words on either side of the reference to a multi-sentence passage. (Hyland 2000 shows that this kind of detection comes easily to corpus-linguistic concordancers, which can oer a good ®rst pass by being asked to search for contexts around strings such as `19**'.) The window can even be extended to the labelled section of the paper in which the citation appearsÐfor example, the Introduction or Methods section. Quite a few researchers have linked cited works to the sections in which they are cited, to see whether the citing works tend to use them in a consistent way (Herlach 1978, Finney 1979, Peritz 1983a, Cano 1989, McCain and Turner 1989, Paul 2000). Citation content analysis works particularly well with highly cited works, so that many citing contexts can contribute information. (This is rather like analysing collocations across concordance lines as described by corpus linguists, e.g., Barnbrook 1996.) When contexts show that citers have used a work to stand for a given idea more or less uniformly over many papers, Small (1978) says that the work has attained the status of a `concept symbol':

104 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

it communicates a speci®c topic and resembles a subject heading or descriptor; today's search engine users might equate it with keywords. For example, one of Small's sample of 52 chemistry papers symbolized atomic scattering factors for 93 percent of the 241 documents that cited it. The paper, `Scattering factors computed from relativistic Dirac-Slater wave functions', published by D. T. Cromer and J. T. Waber in 1965, was cited in one of the citing documents thus: `Atomic scattering factors of Cromer and Waber [10] were used.' (Note that, in this case, a term from Cromer and Waber's title, scattering factors, explicitly recurs in the sentence in which their work is citedÐsomething a computer can be programmed to detect.) According to Small (1982: 304±5): `The rates of uniformity for highly cited documents in chemistry were in the range of 80 percent, re¯ecting the emergence of a standard view or interpretation of a work.' Similarly, Cozzens (1985) found that a famous neuropharmacological paper came, over time, to stand exclusively for its main knowledge claimÐthe discovery of the opiate receptor (the process was complex and did not hold for a comparison paper from sociology of science). Hargens (2000: 859) provides another corroborating example: citations to two foundational papers in economics and cognitive psychology gradually `became highly standardized, almost as if authors shared boilerplate for citing them.' Similar examples can be added from almost any learned literatureÐfor example, a reference nowadays to Bartlett's Remembering almost always evokes schema theory; a reference to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations is often synonymous with his account of categories based on family resemblances, as illustrated by games. (In these examples, it would be terms from passages in Bartlett or Wittgenstein, not from their titles, that would explicitly recur in the citing works.) Cozzens (1982) shows that a scienti®c article may have a double life, as it were, by coming to symbolize two distinct concepts over the course of its citation history. Scienti®c or scholarly concepts occasionally so pervade a culture that their sources are no longer even cited (as when the uncertainty principle is discussed without reference to Heisenberg or paradigm shift, without reference to Kuhn). Citation analysts call this phenomenon `obliteration by incorporation' (Gar®eld 1977, Merton 1979); how OBI occurs is a complex process that, according to Cozzens (1989), has not been satisfactorily studied. On another front, there is some evidence that the scienti®c writings with the highest citation counts and the most longevity over the years tend to convey not theory or empirical results but methods (Gar®eld 1977±78; Peritz 1983b; McCain and Turner 1989). Methodological works also tend to have the most consistent meanings as concept symbols (Small 1982). The fact that cited works can indicate topicality, sometimes very strongly, has obvious implications for document retrieval, the major concern of information science. However, the importance of Small's concept±symbol idea for the ERP tradition is that it suggests how the art of citing might be taught, particularly for writers of scienti®c or technical papers. Writers who

HOWARD D. WHITE

105

cite are, on one level, simply indicating how their papers relate to precedent papers in subject matter (cf. Gar®eld 1979: 1±5). This might be made clear to students by ®rst presenting examples from the Methods sections of scienti®c papers, which often attribute to a precedent work a particular technique, measurement, or formula used by the citer. The student can be shown that such references are a straightforward way of indexing something the citer knows was borrowed to make the new work possible, for example, `Atomic scattering factors of Cromer and Waber [10] were used.' When textual sources are quoted or paraphrased at length, as is very common in the humanities, the imported passages themselves trigger citation. But in scienti®c and technical articles, quotation and extended paraphrase are rare; one imports only `ideas', techniques, and bits of terminology. Nevertheless, these bits of borrowed theory or evidence or method can be treated as explicitly linguistic in nature. That is, if the student's paper is decomposed into signi®cant noun phrases (manually or by software), it should be possible to equate some noun phrases with speci®c earlier works, as if in a table of synonymy, for example:
. Student's mention of scattering factors = Atomic scattering factors = Cromer and Waber 1965 . Student's mention of schema theory = Schema theory = Bartlett 1932

This is cohesion in Halliday and Hasan's (1976) last senseÐreiteration of vocabulary across contextsÐexcept that here the reiteration is not intratextual but intertextual. Essentially the equating process involves intelligent (not blindly mechanical) term-matching. Direct or approximate matches should be possible when words from the cited work are compared with words from the context in which it is cited. The conventionalized reference (e.g. to `Bartlett 1932', with fuller bibliographic information in the footnote or endnote) may then be seen as a substitute for writing out the matches in full. The name of the cited work becomes a kind of compact synonym for the matching terms. Granted, this account does not capture all the complexities of citation. For example, eective references can be based on no matching terms whatever (when Halliday and Hasan illustrate types of cohesion with passages from literary works like Alice in Wonderland, the lines do not match Halliday and Hasan's metalinguistic comments on them). But such references tend to be made by writers who already know their craft. I have in mind, rather, beginners who need help in deciding when and what to cite (cf. the accounts in Cronin 1981; Gar®eld 1996; Young and Leinhardt 1998). For them, the exercise of matching their own explicit terms with those of precedent works could make the logic of citation easier to grasp. Professional scientists and engineers engage in something like this exercise automatically when they cite. As stated above, they also tend to ascribe consistent meanings to writings, making some works into concept symbols. The implication for ERP is that science and technology move by stereotyping works rather than by encouraging diverse interpretations of them. It follows

106 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

that a good way to teach citation in science and technology is to choose documents that are already concept symbols and to show, with concrete termmatching, how they attained that status. Students might then be assigned to cite such documents in trial papers, but to hold to their concept±symbol meanings until they have a feeling for the citation practices of the professionals. This would combine with their reading and conference-going under the supervision of disciplinary mentors to instill a sense of what and what not to reference and how to set the contexts (cf. Dong 1996). My proposal derives from the `shallow understanding' of texts that information scientists seek toward ends such as summarization or retrieval. Scienti®c papers lend themselves well to surface processing by computer. Explicit features of their structure and vocabulary can be exploited, especially when they occur across writings. My own Tables 3 and 4 were possible because terms from many cited references piled up for easy harvesting. Small's (1978) concept symbols emerge because terms from the sentences around the references similarly pile up. Probably the only hope for citation classi®cation, in the sense of Moravcsik and Murugesan, Chubin and Moitra, and others, is through computer recognition of recurrent surface features. For example, I said earlier that it might be impossible for computers to recognize a `negative, juxtapositional' citation because of the implicitness of the criteria. But computers can recognize a citation marked like `MacRoberts and MacRoberts (1984)', and they can be programmed to associate neighbouring phrases (such as `it is not at all clear how . . .' and `without giving evidence, the MacRobertses claim . . .') with negative citation. Obviously, processing of this sort will involve brute-force recognition and correct categorization of formulaic phrases on an industrial scale, and the computer will make many mistakes. But some such eort at automation is where the future of discourse-analytic citation analysis lies. This brings us to the work of Simone Teufel, probably the fullest and most sophisticated integration of information science with ERP to date. A computer scientist by training, she and her colleagues are working on algorithmic summarization of scienti®c articles. In the process, they combine discourse analysis, citation analysis, information retrieval techniques, and natural language processing. The goal is to extract or synthesize a coherent prose account that is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the original. Past eorts have usually presented content-laden extracts stripped of context. Teufel's idea is to restore `the discourse context of extracted material by adding the rhetorical status to each sentence in a document' (Teufel and Moens 2002: 410). By design, her categories are related to the CARS model described in Swales (1990: 141)Ðthat is, to moves that Create a Research Space, such as goal-setting or producing metadiscourse on the structure of the article. The categories also encode citation relations, such as whether precedent work is being referred to, whether it is the citer's or someone else's, and, echoing Moravcsik and Murugesan's categories, whether the present work is based on the precedent work or a contrast to it. While her

HOWARD D. WHITE

107

research is at a very early stage, it seems to hold great promise. Similar work is going on in Japan (e.g. Nanba and Okumura 1999; Nanba et al. 2000).

CITER MOTIVATIONS
A third stream of research, complementing the two presented thus far, examines why authors make references (Brooks 1988; Bonzi and Snyder 1991; Case and Higgins 2000). According to White (2001), the global reason for citing is the perceived relevance of a document to a work in hand, but more speci®c motives can be elicited through interviews or inferred from texts. A number of writers have classi®ed them, and their ®ndings bear on ERP; for example, they can help students decide when a citation is called for. Students may also here encounter interesting issues of intellectual honesty. The oldest citation classi®cation schemeÐGar®eld 1965 (reprinted in Weinstock 1971 and Gar®eld 1979)Ðlists citer motivations, apparently inferred from citation contexts, as verbal phrases. To give the ¯avour, the ®rst nine of 15 are: (1) paying homage to pioneers; (2) giving credit for related work; (3) identifying methods, equipment, etc.; (4) providing background reading; (5) correcting one's own work; (6) correcting the work of others; (7) criticizing previous work; (8) substantiating claims; and (9) alerting researchers to forthcoming work. These imply psychological agency or even speech acts on the part of citers, in contrast to the adjectival categories of schemes that capture coders' judgements (e.g. Moravcsik and Murugesan's organic/perfunctory, or Chubin and Moitra's basic/subsidiary) rather than citers' intentions. Apparently no one has used Gar®eld's categories verbatim to gather frequency data. The second oldest list of reasons for citing, Hodges (1972), was based on what later authors such as Cronin (1984) and Brooks (1984) said had never been doneÐlive interviews with citers. Published in a long doctoral dissertation rather than a journal article, Hodges's scheme was overlooked until Peritz (1983a) brought it to light. Its 14 categories (reproduced in Brooks 1988) are not cast as verbal phrases re¯ecting citers' speech acts, but as adjectives re¯ecting Hodges's complicated judgements (e.g. `Evidential', `Corroborative', `Sibling', `Clari®cational'). In the familiar pattern, Peritz found the Hodges scheme dicult to apply directly and simpli®ed it for use on citation contexts in ®ve social science journals. Peritz's most frequent category by far was `Setting the Stage', which occurred overwhelmingly in the Introduction section of scienti®c articles, as Swales's (1990: 137±66) account of rhetorical moves in that section would predict. The most elaborate continuation of Hodges's style of research, in which citer motives are learned through interviews and then ®tted into a complex, post-hoc scheme, is White and Wang's (1997) qualitative study of 12 agricultural economists (continued in Wang and White 1999). Respondents were asked to explain why they cited particular documents in the course of preparing various new writings of their own. White and Wang's work

108 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

commendably links earlier motives for retrieving and reading documents with later motives for citing (or not citing) them, and is rich in direct quotes from citers about their decisions. White and Wang devised schemes to cover citers' remarks on, ®rst, the contributions that cited documents made to their new writings; second, the criteria they used in choosing documents to cite; and, third, their metalevel documentation concerns (e.g. completeness of reference lists, propriety of self-citation, and anticipated expectations of referees). The `contributions' of the ®rst scheme are reasons for citing that emerge from contexts in the new document, such as providing an analogy or justifying an idea, whereas the `criteria' of the second are characteristics of the cited document, such as its topic or recency. Turning again to the big picture, what larger intentions drive citers? As Case and Higgins (2000) point out, one of the main threads of citer-motivation research since the mid-1980s has been tests of what might be called `the persuasion hypothesis'. That is, when authors cite, are they mainly rewarding others for the use of their intellectual property, or are they marshalling earlier documents in such a way as to persuade readers of the goodness of their claims? In `Referencing as persuasion', Gilbert (1977) argued in¯uentially that it was the latter (his `note' has been cited in more than 150 articles and continues to be cited to this day). The contrasting `reward hypothesis' is associated with the norms-based sociology of science of Robert K. Merton. Citation analysis has always had its Mertonian wing, which includes Gar®eld, ISI's founder; the ®rst two motives in the Gar®eld±Weinstock list above capture aspects of reward, but none (including those not shown) has much to do with persuasion. Gilbert's counterargument can be seen as part of the discourse-analytic turn that the sociology of science has taken since the 1970s, partly in reaction to Merton's relative neglect of texts as constructors of knowledge. On one level, Gilbert has won; no one seriously doubts that writers write to persuade and that that intention shapes their choices of what to cite. There is even survey evidence to that eect. Using a list of motives proposed in earlier studies as a questionnaire, Brooks (1984) asked a small, multidisciplinary sample of academics why they cited. `Persuasion' topped the responses. But persuasion to the exclusion of rewardÐwhich Gilbert impliesÐhas been called into question. Brooks (1986) established what he called `complex citer motives' by noting, among other things, that desire to persuade and desire to give positive credit were positively correlated as variables. Cozzens (1989) sensibly argued that citers cite both as a reward to others for their intellectual contributions and as a tool of persuasion; of the two, she thought persuasion the more important because of its greater conduciveness to a successful career. Her model is `rhetoric ®rst, reward second', which agrees well enough with Brooks. Several later studies have also cast doubt on Gilbert's account of how persuasion works. He implies that citers invoke authoritative earlier works to make their own new work more convincing, whether or not the older works are

HOWARD D. WHITE

109

really relevant. `Indeed,' he writes, `respected papers may be cited in order to shine in their re¯ected glory even if they do not seem closely related to the substantive content of the report' (Gilbert 1977: 116). He thus replaces the researcher's scienti®c motive, establishing the truth, with a social motive, citing to attach to a tradition respected for truthfulness, hinting dryly that it may be the goodness of the attachment rather than of the science that persuades. This is a social constructivist position. Covering the same ground, the more ¯amboyant Latour (1987) treats references as resources for persuasion rather like battalions. But he warns that their force may vanish if readers actually read what authors cite: `First, many references may be misquoted or wrong; second, many of the articles alluded to might have no bearing whatsovever on the claim and might be there just for display [italics mine]; third, other citations might be present but only because they are always present in the author's articles, whatever his claim, to mark aliation and show with which group of scientists he identi®esÐthese citations are called perfunctory' (Latour 1987: 33±4). Neither Gilbert nor Latour, I think, actually believes that re¯ectedglory references persuade if their true nature is discovered (Latour calls this result `disastrous' for the author). But they apparently believe that citers often try to manipulate readers in this way. Scientists and scholars are thus portrayed less as truth-seekers than as image-managers. Such a portrayal is controversial, to say the least. The issue boils down to the question, What persuades? Is it the quality of the arguments of which the citations are part, or is it the reputation of the citees? This is an important question for rhetoricians and discourse analysts in the ERP tradition, because, if reputations are the decisive factor, then science and scholarship can to some extent be faked by writers skilled at dropping authoritative names. That such fakery occurs seems to be fairly widely accepted. For example, Swales (2002) drew my attention to graduate students' papers `with a lot of big names in theory up front, the connection of which to the small-scale empirical study being reported is at best obscure'; Becker (2003) told me that young sociologists feel they must pad their references with irrelevant authorities to get journal editors to accept their papers. Must students learn to drop names as the main lesson in writing persuasively? Probably not. There is, after all, little hard evidence that numerous researchers seek `re¯ected glory' from references that are included `just for display' (Gilbert and Latour themselves give no examples). Moreover, the evidence from statistical studies indicates otherwise. In a closely reasoned discussion of the persuasion hypothesis, Zuckerman (1987: 334±5) maintains that, if citers seek to increase the persuasiveness of their own works merely by referencing `respected' or `authoritative' papers whenever possible, then a large fraction of citations overall should go to papers that are already wellcited. But that, she notes, does not happen. Statistics for the Science Citation Index show that papers cited at least 10 times a year over a ®ve-year period received only half of 1 per cent of all the citations given in that period. Even if

110 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

the threshold for calling papers `authoritative' is dropped to two citations per year over ®ve years, such papers received only 6 per cent of all citations. Zuckerman comments, `If citation by authority signi®cantly guided citation practice, then a much higher proportion of all citations would go to these authoritative papers.' Instead, almost two-thirds of all citations went to papers cited only once in ®ve years. This result may seem inconsistent with the famous `Matthew eect', named by Merton himself, which predicts that authors who are already well-cited will get a disproportionate share of additional citations (Merton 1968, 1988). But Zuckerman is not denying the Matthew eect; she is simply noting that citations to `ordinary' authors far outnumber citations to the stars and superstars. When the total picture is taken into account, citers do not appear to be seeking re¯ected glory to persuade. Of course, they might not admit it, even if they were (cf. Baldi 1998). As an alternative to extracting confessions, researchers can gather data on citers in particular ®elds and ask whether they tend to overcite authors whose citation counts are already high. This has been done in three bibliometric studies, all of which undermine the re¯ected-glory argument. The most recent is Van Dalen and Henkens (2001). I quote from their summary of the contending viewpoints (pp. 457±8)Ðone `universalistic' or Mertonian; the other, constructivist:
If citations are indeed only based on scienti®c merit and not correlated with extra-scienti®c attributes there are no grounds to question the reward structure of science. If, however, extra-scienti®c attributes play a signi®cant role in the allocation of citations, the universalistic norm may not be an accurate re¯ection of how science evolves. Social constructivists like Latour (1987), Lindsay (1978) and Gilbert (1977) believe that the universalist norm is being systematically violated. *** Stewart (1983) has examined the number of citations received by a selection of articles in geophysical research published in selected journals in 1968. He concluded that although universalism was the most important underlying principle in the allocation of recognition, there was some evidence of reputation eects. The additional eect on citation frequency was, however, relatively small. In his study on the astrophysics research area, Baldi (1998) included not only the characteristics of cited articles but also the characteristics of the citing articles. He discovered that authors `are most likely to cite articles that are relevant to their work in terms of subject, recency of knowledge, theoretical orientation, and seem to have little concern with the characteristics of authors who wrote them' (Baldi 1998, p. 843). Van Dalen and Henkens (2001: 457±8)

In their own multivariate analysis of what causes demography articles to be highly cited, Van Dalen and Henkens (2001: 476) obtained results similar to Stewart's: `The table shows that journal characteristics are the most important factors in my model. Although article and author characteristics provide some

HOWARD D. WHITE

111

additional explanatory power, I should add that the contribution of author characteristics is rather small.' The data used in Stewart (1983), Baldi (1998), and Van Dalen and Henkens (2001) were gathered unobtrusively from publications, not from interviews with citers. But four recent interview-based studiesÐShadish et al. (1995), Vinkler (1998), Wang and White (1999), and Case and Higgins (2000)Ðall tend to support the publication-based ®ndings. The vast majority of citer decisions are motivated by what Vinkler (1998) calls `professional' (as opposed to `connectional') concernsÐbroadly, the perceived relevance and quality of precedent work, its scienti®c merit, rather than the reputations or personal connections of the citees. Those who believe that successful citing is really a matter of lining up the `right' names have produced no comparable body of evidence. Let me be precise: there is no question that writers cite prestigious authors and respected works when trying to write persuasively. The eects of author prestige reported in the publications-based research, although small, are probably quite real. The question is, rather, whether use of such authors is warranted or unwarranted. Warranted use involves citing something because, by logic that quali®ed readers can follow, it helps to develop a new case. (This would include the type of citing, called `ceremonial' in Cole 1975 and `totemic' in Hargens 2000, that uses authorities simply as orienting ®gures.) Unwarranted use involves dragging in prestigious works `even if they do not seem closely related to the substantive content of the report,' as Gilbert puts it. Widespread unwarranted use is what constructivists have not shown. If such use were indeed widespread, author eects in publication-based studies would be stronger than they are, and interview studies would likely turn up a few whistle-blowers who want to give the game away. The phenomenon would also presumably be detectable in the writings of the constructivists themselves (e.g. Gilbert and Mulkay 1984, Latour 1987, Myers 1990). Yet I ®nd no evidence of empty name-dropping on their part; in my reading, they play the citation game straight. According to the statistical studies mentioned above, that is what other scholars and scientists also do most of the time. The lesson for teachers of ERP is that citing can be taught uncynically: what persuades are the statements to which citations contribute, not the re¯ected glory of cited names. How else, I might add, can one account for cases in which the same authority is adduced in the context of opposing arguments? While Luukkonen (1997) cites Latour's Science in Action admiringly, Baldi (1998) cites the same book critically. One could hardly claim that both papers are equally convincing because they both draw lustre from the same famous work.

CONCLUSION
Like Swales (1986), the present article is a call for greater integration of the various research specialties that contribute to citation analysis. Studies that

112 CITATION ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS REVISITED

cite representatives of the dierent specialties in an ad hoc way will very likely continue to appear. But to increase the theoretical scope of the whole ®eld, individual studies must be put into a larger framework. This requires regarding citation as a complex communicative process with syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic variables. The variables may be studied both within documents and across documents, whether the latter are left disaggregated in given subject areas or are aggregated by author, organization, or journal. If rhetorical analyses of citation practices within documents were used to explain ®ndings in cross-textual (i.e. bibliometric) citation studies, that might give the still-dishevelled theory of citing a whole new look. For example, so far as I know, no one has seriously examined citation in light of speech act theory, and that might be a new area of convergence for discourse analysts to develop, with `verb-oriented' works like Myers (1992) and Hawes and Thomas (1997) as forerunners. No one has yet worked out in detail how the contending accounts of citation might best serve teachers of ERP, and that seems another area ripe for development. Writings to consider in creating the larger framework appear in Tables 3 and 4, which, as noted above, resemble the bibliography for a review-synthesis of citation analysis along interdisciplinary lines. The tables implicitly show that such a synthesis is warranted. It is not as if the literatures from the dierent traditions were wholly separate and could only be joined through massive creative reading; many researchers have already perceived connections. What is missing is a new study that would unite the ®ndings and the arguments of the various writings under discourse-analytic headings. The speci®c goal would be to explain as much of citation as possible by integrating rhetorical analysis with the psychological, sociological, and bibliometric treatments seen to date. The present article combines with Swales (1986) to raise consciousness toward that end. Final version received June 2003
