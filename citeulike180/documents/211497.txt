germination. We evaluated the seed±recruit relationship using linear regression of log transformed values of R  1 and S  1 to normalize residuals. In these regressions, the ®tted constant b takes values of less than 1 if the per seed probability of recruitment is inversely related to seed density. Species were excluded from regression analyses if (1) seeds passed through the 1-mm trap mesh, (2) seeds or recruits were recorded at fewer than 10 stations, or (3) seed or recruit density varied less than a factor of four among stations Fifty-three species remained including 28 trees, 20 lianas and ®ve shrubs. These 53 focal species account for 60.3% of the seed rain and 80.4% of recruits. None of the 53 species persist for more than one year in the soil seed bank. To insure that the regression results were not spurious or artefactual, we conducted several additional tests. First, some traps received many more seeds than could possibly recruit into adjacent seedling plots (simple space limitation). Second, in many instances, seedlings of a given species recruited into some seedling plots, but no seeds of that species were found in the adjacent seed traps. Either or both of these effects would lower b-value estimates and in¯ate the apparent importance of density dependence. Third, empty stations, lacking both seeds and recruits, introduce an opposing bias, and raise the b-value estimates. To control for the effect of space limitation, we conducted analyses excluding stations in which single species seed densities exceeded the maximum single species recruit density (66 seedlings m-2). To control for the other biases, we conducted analyses after excluding stations lacking conspeci®c seed. We then eliminated all of these effects by including only stations with non-zero seed densities less than 66 seed m-2. Finally, the addition of 1 before taking logarithms gives b values a downward bias. This effect can be large, particularly when the ratio of seeds to recruits is large. To evaluate the effect of this ®nal potential bias, we compared 95% con®dence intervals of the observed b values with b values predicted in the absence of density dependence. Observed b values were signi®cantly less than predicted b values for every species. In all cases, these more conservative tests substantiated the pervasive and strong effects of negative density dependence on seedling recruitment.

Animal communication is typically non-syntactic, which means that signals refer to whole situations1±7. Human language is syntactic, and signals consist of discrete components that have their own meaning8. Syntax is a prerequisite for taking advantage of combinatorics, that is, ``making in®nite use of ®nite means''9±11. The vast expressive power of human language would be impossible without syntax, and the transition from non-syntactic to syntactic communication was an essential step in the evolution of human language12±16. We aim to understand the evolutionary dynamics of this transition and to analyse how natural selection can guide it. Here we present a model for the population dynamics of language evolution, de®ne the basic reproductive ratio of words and calculate the maximum size of a lexicon. Syntax allows larger repertoires and the possibility to formulate messages that have not been learned beforehand. Nevertheless, according to our model natural selection can only favour the emergence of syntax if the number of required signals exceeds a threshold value. This result might explain why only humans evolved syntactic communication and hence complex language. The uniqueness of language has been compared to that of the elephant's trunk13. Human language is as different from animal communication as the elephant's trunk is from other animals' nostrils. Yet few biologists worry about the evolution of the elephant's trunk (which is a most complex organ that consists of about 6,000 individual muscles and that can perform an unparalleled variety of mechanical tasks), whereas many philosophers, linguists and biologists have great dif®culties in imagining how language could have arisen by darwinian evolution17±21. A challenge for evolutionary biology, therefore, is to provide a detailed mathematical account of how natural selection can enable the emergence of human language from animal communication. Animal communication is based on three basic designs: a ®nite repertoire of calls (territorial calls or warning of predators); a continuous analogue signal (for example, the dance of bees); and a series of random variations on a theme (such as the song of birds). All natural animal communication appears to be non-syntactic; some caution, however, seems appropriate as the ®nal verdict on complex vocalization patterns of certain primate species or dolphins has not been reached. In contrast, human language is clearly syntactic: messages consist of components that have their own meaning. We compare non-syntactic and syntactic communication and evaluate their relative performance in an evolutionary setting. First, we formulate a mathematical model for the population dynamics of language evolution. Suppose a language contains n

words. Each individual is born not knowing any of the words, but can acquire words by learning from other individuals. Individuals are characterized by the subset of words that they know. The general equations for the resulting evolutionary dynamics are complicated (see Methods), but an analytical approach is possible if we describe the process in terms of independent, elementary steps on the basis of two assumptions: ®rst, in any one interaction between two individuals only a single new word can be learned; second, words are memorized independently of each other. With these assumptions, we obtain for the population dynamics of xi, which is the relative abundance of individuals who know word Wi Ç xi  Ri xi 1 2 xi  2 xi 1 where i  1; ¼; n. The abundance of word Wi spreads by the interaction of people who know the word with people who do not know the word; hence its rate of increase is proportional to the product xi 1 2 xi . The rate constant, Ri  bqfi , is the basic reproductive ratio of word Wi. This is the average number of individuals who acquire word Wi from one individual who knows it. The parameter b is the total number of word-learning events per individual per lifetime. The parameter q is the probability of memorizing a single word after one encounter, and fi is the frequency of occurrence of word Wi in the (spoken) language. The term -xi denotes a constant death rate, setting the average lifetime of each individual as one time unit. For a word to be maintained in the lexicon of the population, its basic reproductive ratio must exceed one, which implies that fi . 1=bq. Suppose Wi is the least frequent word. We certainly know that fi is less than 1/n, which is the frequency of a word if all words have the same frequency. Thus the maximum number of words is nmax  bq. Note that this number is always less than the total number of words, b, that are presented to a learning individual. Hence, the lexicon of the population cannot exceed the total number of word-learning events for each individual. Assuming that word frequency distributions follow Zipf 's law22,23, fi  C=i, where C is a constant, we ®nd that the maximum number of words is roughly given by the equation nmax lnnmax   bq (Fig. 1). We now use this mathematical framework to analyse how natural selection can guide the transition from non-syntactic to syntactic communication. Imagine a group of individuals who communicate about events in the world around them. Events are combinations of objects, places, times and actions. (We use `object' and `action' in a general way to represent everything that can be referred to by nouns and verbs of current human languages.) For notational simplicity, suppose that each event consists of one object and one action. Thus, event Eij consists of object i and action j. Non-syntactic communication uses words for events, whereas syntactic communication uses words for objects and actions (Fig. 2). Events occur at different rates, which are speci®ed by the entries of an `event rate matrix', G. For natural selection to operate on language design, language must confer ®tness. A plausible assumption is that correct communication about events provides a ®tness advantage to the interacting individuals. In terms of our model, the ®tness contribution of a language can be formulated as the probability that two individuals know the correct word for a given event summed over all events and weighted with the rate of occurrence of these events. The population dynamics of non-syntactic communication are again given by equation (1) with word Wij referring to event Eij. As before, the maximum number of words that can be maintained in the population is limited by bq. We calculate the ®tness of individuals using non-syntactic communication (see Methods). We now turn to syntactic communication. Noun Ni refers to object i and verb Vj refers to action j, hence the event Eij is described by the sentence NiVj. For the basic reproductive ratios we obtain RN i   b=2qs fN i  and RV j   b=2qs fV j . Here f(Ni) and f(Vj) denote the frequency of occurrence of noun Ni and verb Vj, respectively. The factor 1/2 appears because either the noun or the verb is learned in any one of the b learning events. The probability of memorizing a noun or a verb is given by qs. We expect qs to be smaller than q, which simply means that it is a more dif®cult task to learn a syntactic signal than a non-syntactic signal. For both signals, the (arbitrary) meaning has to be memorized; for a syntactic signal one must also memorize its relation to other signals (whether it is a noun or a verb, for example). For noun Ni to be maintained in the lexicon of the population, its basic reproductive ratio must exceed one, implying that fN i  . 2=bqs . Similarly, for verb Vj we ®nd fV j  . 2=bqs . This means that the total number of nouns plus verbs is limited by bqs, which is always less than b. The maximum number of grammatical sentences, however, which consist of one noun and one verb, is given by (bqs)2/4. Hence syntax makes it possible to maintain more sentences than the total number of sentences, b, encountered by a learning individual. All words have to be learned, therefore, but syntactic signals enable the formulation of `new' sentences that have not been learned beforehand.

Figure 1 How many word-learning events per individual are required for a population to maintain a certain number of words in its combined lexicon assuming that word frequencies follow Zipf's law? Zipf's law states that the frequency fi of occurrence of a word is inversely proportional to its position, i, in a frequency ranking. Zipf's law seems to be a very good approximation for every human language. Nobody knows its signi®cance. It can be shown, however, that a random source emitting symbols and spaces also generates word frequency distributions following Zipf's law23. Assuming that n words follow a frequency distribution as in Zipf's law, fi  C n =i where C n  1=Sn 1=i, the i1 maximum number of words that can be maintained, nmax, is the largest integer, n, which ful®ls the inequality fn  C n =n . 1=bq. The ®gure shows nmax versus b for q  0:1. The exact relationship is a step function because both b and nmax are integers. The equation n max g  ln n max   bq is an excellent approximation (continuous line). Here we have used Euler's gamma which is g  0:5772¼ . For example, to maintain a lexicon of 100 words, we need about bq  520 successful word-learning events per individual. For q  0:1, this implies that a total of roughly b  5;200 word-learning events per individual are required.

Wij Eij = Oi + Aj Ni Vj

Figure 2 To understand the essence of the evolution of syntax, we imagine a world where each event consists of one object and one action. Event Eij consists of object Oi and action Aj. A non-syntactic language has words, Wij, that refer to events, Eij. A syntactic language has words for objects and actions, Ni and Vj. Words for objects are called nouns, words for actions are called verbs. Our mathematical analysis can also be adapted to more complicated situations, where events consist of several objects, actions, places or times, but the equations become more clumsy. The principles remain the same.

For calculating the ®tness of syntactic communication, note that two randomly chosen individuals can communicate about event Eij if they both know noun Ni and verb Vj. If we denote the relative abundance of individuals who know Ni and Vj by xN i V j , we obtain Ç xN i V j   RN i xN i xV j  2 xN i V j   RV j xV j xN i  2 xN i V j  2 xN i V j  2 who knows verb Vj meets someone who knows Ni but not Vj. We calculate the equilibrium abundances and thence the ®tness of individuals using syntactic communication (see Methods). Figure 3 shows the ®tness of syntactic and non-syntactic communication as a function of b for different examples of the event rate matrix, G. When does syntactic communication lead to a higher ®tness than non-syntactic communication? Suppose there are n objects and m actions. Suppose a fraction, p, of these mn events occur (all at the same frequency), and the other events do not occur. In this case, RW ij   bq=pmn for those events that occur. Making the (somewhat rough) assumption that all nouns and all verbs, respectively, occur on average at the same frequency, we obtain RN i   bqs =2n and RV j   bqs =2m. If all involved basic reproductive ratios are well above one, the ®tness of syntactic communication exceeds the ®tness of non-syntactic communication provided m2 n  mn2 = m2  mn  n2  . 2q=pqs  (see Methods). If this inequality holds then syntactic communication will be favoured by natural selection; otherwise non-syntactic communication will win. Observe that m $ 3 and n $ 3 are necessary conditions for the evolution of syntax. For m  n, the relevant condition is n . 3q=pqs

Hence, the size of the system has to exceed a critical value for syntactic communication to evolve. For example, if it is twice as hard to memorize a syntactic signal than a non-syntactic signal, q=qs  1=2, and if a fraction p  1=3 of all noun verb combinations describe meaningful events, then at least an 18 3 18 system is required for syntactic communication to have any chance of evolving. Figure 4 shows the excellent agreement between our approximative analytical results and exact numerical computations. The parameter p quanti®es to what extent the perceived world has a compositional structure. A small p means that events often consist of unique pairings of objects and actions. The smaller the value of p, the harder it is for syntactic communication to evolve (the critical n in equation (3) is large). Our results suggest that the crucial step that guided the transition from non-syntactic to syntactic communication was an increase in the number of relevant events that could be referred to. `Relevant event' means there is a ®tness contribution for communication about this event. As the number of such `relevant communication topics' increased, natural selection could begin to favour syntactic

Figure 3 The ®tness of non-syntactic and syntactic communication, Fn and Fs, as function of the total number of word learning events per individual, b, for three different choices of the event rate matrix, G. The entries of G are the numbers gij which characterize the rates at which the various events occur. a, There are four objects and four actions. Each object is associated with a speci®c action; in addition object 1 also occurs with action 2. All possible events occur at the same rate. Thus the event rate matrix is a binary 4 3 4 matrix with 5 non-zero entries, p  5=16. For b ranging from 50 to 10,000, F n always exceeds Fs. b, There are six objects and six actions, the event rate matrix has 20 non-zero entries, p  5=9. For values of b less than 400, syntactic communication has a higher ®tness than non-syntactic communication. For values of b above 400, non-syntactic communication wins. Hence, for medium-sized systems the emergence of syntactic communication can be prevented by increasing the number of learning events per individual. c, There are 10 objects and 10 actions, 65 of 100 combinations occur, p  13=20. In this case, syntactic communication wins for any choice of b. Each panel shows Fn and Fs as function of b and illustrates the chosen event rate matrix, G.

Figure 4 Numerical validation of the approximate threshold condition given by equation (3). If this inequality holds then syntax will be favoured by natural selection. There is communication about n objects and m actions. A fraction, p of the nm object±action combinations refers to events that occur in the world. The parameters q and qs denote, respectively, the probability of memorizing a non-syntactic and a syntactic signal after a single occurrence. We choose n  m, b  5;000 and q  0:1. The values of n range from 2 to 25. For each n we compute Fs and Fn for 1,000 randomly chosen event-rate matrices G, whose entries are 1 with probability p or 0 otherwise.

communication and thereby lead to a language design where messages could be formulated that were not learned beforehand. Syntactic messages can encode new ideas or refer to extremely rare but important events. Our theory, however, does not suggest that syntactic communication is always at an advantage. Many animal species probably have a syntactic understanding of the world, but natural selection did not produce a syntactic communication system for these species because the number of relevant signals was below the threshold illustrated by equation (3). Presumably the increase in the number of relevant communication topics was caused by changes in the social structure24 and interaction of those human ancestors who evolved syntactic communication. M

Suppose there are n words. Individuals are characterized by the subset of words they know. There are 2n possibilities for the internal lexicon of an individual. Internal lexica are de®ned by bit strings: 1 means that the corresponding word is known; 0 means it is not. Let us enumerate them by I  0; ¼; n where n  2n 2 1. The number I is the integer representation of the corresponding bit string. (For example, I  6 represents the string 000¼0110.) Denote by xI the abundance of individuals with internal lexicon I. The population dynamics can be formulated as Ç x I  dI 2 x I  b

where I  0; ¼; n. We have d0  1 and dI  0 otherwise; thus all individuals are born not knowing any of the words. Individuals die at a constant rate, which we set to 1, thereby de®ning a time scale. The quantities QIJK denote the probabilities that individual I learning from J will become K. Equation (4) is a general framework for the population dynamics of the lexical aspects of language. Assuming that in any one interaction between two individuals only a single new word can be acquired and that words are memorized independently of each other, we obtain the speci®c system described by equation (1). Let us now assume that the world is made up of events Eij consisting of objects i and actions j. The `event rate matrix', G has the entries gij which specify the relative rate of occurrence of event Eij. Denote by fij the frequency of occurrence of event Eij. We have fij  gij =Sij gij . Non-syntactic communication uses words, Wij, for events Eij. The basic reproductive ratio of Wij is given by RW ij   bqfij. If RW ij  . 1, the word Wij will persist in the population, and at equilibrium the relative abundance of individuals who know this word is given by x*W ij   1 2 1=RW ij . The ®tness contribution of a language can be formulated as the probability that two individuals know the correct word for a given event summed over all events and weighted with the rate of occurrence of these events. Hence, at equilibrium, the ®tness of individuals using non-syntactic communication is given by Fn

For syntactic communication, we assume the event Eij is described by the sentence NiVj. The population dynamics of individuals knowing both Ni and Vj are described by equation (2). The basic reproductive ratios are given by RN i   b=2qs fN i  and RV j   b=2qs fV i . The frequencies of occurrence are fN i   Sj fij and fV j   Si fij . If the basic reproductive ratios, R(Ni) and R(Vj), are greater than one, the equilibrium frequency of individuals who know both Ni and Vj is given by x*N i V j   1 2 1=RN i 1 2 1=RV j  1 2 1=RN i   RV j  6

At equilibrium, the ®tness of syntactic communication is given by Fs

Assuming there are n objects and m actions that give rise to pnm meaningful events that all occur at the same frequency, we obtain RW ij   bq=pnm. If we also assume that the combinations of objects and actions are arranged in a way that all nouns and all verbs, respectively, have about the same frequency, we can write RN i   bq2 =2n and RV j   bqs =2m. For the ®tness values, we obtain F n  pnm1 2 1=RW ij 2 and F s  pnm1 2 1=RN i 2 1 2 1=RV j 2 =1 2 1=RN i   RV j 2 . Assuming that all involved basic reproductive ratios are well above one, we obtain for F s , F n the condition m2 n  mn2 =m2  mn  n2  . 2q=pqs . De®ning the ratio, a  m=n, we can rewrite this condition as   2q 1 1 : 8 1 2 n. pqs a a1 Hence the size of the system has to exceed a critical threshold for syntax to be favoured by natural selection.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) found on synaptic terminals throughout the brain are thought to be important in modulating neurotransmission1,2. Activation of mGluRs by synaptically released glutamate depresses glutamate release from excitatory terminals3±5 but the physiological role of mGluRs on inhibitory terminals is unclear. We have investigated activation of mGluRs on inhibitory terminals within the cerebellar glomerulus, a structure in which GABA (g-aminobutyric acid)-releasing inhibitory terminals and glutamatergic excitatory terminals are in close apposition and make axo-dendritic synapses onto granule cells6. Here we show that `spillover' of glutamate, which is released from excitatory mossy ®bres, inhibits GABA release from Golgi cell terminals by activating presynaptic mGluRs under physiological conditions.
