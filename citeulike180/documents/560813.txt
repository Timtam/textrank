Identification of protein­protein interactions often provides insight into protein function, and many cellular processes are performed by stable protein complexes. We used tandem affinity purification to process 4,562 different tagged proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each preparation was analysed by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization­time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to increase coverage and accuracy. Machine learning was used to integrate the mass spectrometry scores and assign probabilities to the protein­protein interactions. Among 4,087 different proteins identified with high confidence by mass spectrometry from 2,357 successful purifications, our core data set (median precision of 0.69) comprises 7,123 protein­protein interactions involving 2,708 proteins. A Markov clustering algorithm organized these interactions into 547 protein complexes averaging 4.9 subunits per complex, about half of them absent from the MIPS database, as well as 429 additional interactions between pairs of complexes. The data (all of which are available online) will help future studies on individual proteins as well as functional genomics and systems biology.
Elucidation of the budding yeast genome sequence1 initiated a decade of landmark studies addressing key aspects of yeast cell biology on a system-wide level. These included microarray-based analysis of gene expression2, screens for various biochemical activities3,4, identification of protein subcellular locations5,6, and identifying effects of single and pairwise gene disruptions7­10. Other efforts were made to catalogue physical interactions among yeast proteins, primarily using the yeast two-hybrid method11,12 and direct purification via affinity tags13,14; many of these interactions are conserved in other organisms15. Data from the yeast protein­protein interaction studies have been non-overlapping to a surprising degree, a fact explained partly by experimental inaccuracy and partly by indications that no single screen has been comprehensive16.
Proteome-wide purification of protein complexes Of the various high throughput experimental methods used thus far to identify protein­protein interactions11­14, tandem affinity purification (TAP) of affinity-tagged proteins expressed from their

natural chromosomal locations followed by mass spectrometry13,17 has provided the best coverage and accuracy16. To map more completely the yeast protein interaction network (interactome), S. cerevisiae strains were generated with in-frame insertions of TAP tags individually introduced by homologous recombination at the 3 0 end of each predicted open reading frame (ORF) (http:// www.yeastgenome.org/)18,19. Proteins were purified from 4L yeast cultures under native conditions, and the identities of the copurifying proteins (preys) determined in two complementary ways17. Each purified protein preparation was electrophoresed on an SDS polyacrylamide gel, stained with silver, and visible bands removed and identified by trypsin digestion and peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization­ time of flight (MALDI­TOF) mass spectrometry. In parallel, another aliquot of each purified protein preparation was digested in solution and the peptides were separated and sequenced by data-dependent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS)17,20­22. Because either mass spectrometry method often fails to

identify a protein, we used two independent mass spectrometry methods to increase interactome coverage and confidence. Among the attempted purifications of 4,562 different proteins (Supplementary Table S1), including all predicted non-membrane proteins, 2,357 purifications were successful (Supplementary Table S2) in that at least one protein was identified (in 1,613 cases by MALDI­TOF mass spectrometry and in 2,001 cases by LC-MS/MS; Fig. 1a) that was not present in a control preparation from an untagged strain. In total, 4,087 different yeast proteins were identified as preys with high confidence ($99%; see Methods) by MALDI­TOF mass spectrometry and/or LC-MS/MS, corresponding to 72% of the predicted yeast proteome (Supplementary Table S3). Smaller proteins with a relative molecular mass (M r) of 35,000 were less likely to be identified (Fig. 1b), perhaps because they generate fewer peptides suited for identification by mass spectrometry. We were more successful in identifying smaller proteins by LC-MS/MS than by MALDI­TOF mass spectrometry, probably because smaller proteins stain less well with silver or ran off the SDS gels. Our success in protein identification was unrelated to protein essentiality (data not shown) and ranged from 80% for low abundance proteins to over 90% for high abundance proteins (Fig. 1c). Notably, we identified 47% of the proteins not detected by genome-wide western blotting18, indicating that affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry can be more sensitive. Many hypothetical proteins not detected by western blotting18 or our mass spectrometry analyses may not be expressed in our standard cell growth conditions. Although our success rates for identifying proteins were 94% and 89% for nuclear and cytosolic proteins, respectively, and at least 70% in most cellular compartments (Fig. 1d), they were lower (61% and 59%, respectively) for the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuole. However, even though we had not tagged or purified most proteins with transmembrane

domains, we identified over 70% of the membrane-associated proteins, perhaps because our extraction and purification buffers contained 0.1% Triton X-100. Our identification success rate was lowest (49%) with proteins for which localization was not established5,6, many of which may not be expressed. We had high success in identifying proteins involved in all biological processes, as defined by gene ontology (GO) nomenclature, or possessing any broadly defined GO molecular function (Fig. 1e, f). We were less successful (each about 65% success) with transporters and proteins of unknown function; many of the latter may not be expressed.
A high-quality data set of protein­protein interactions Deciding whether any two proteins interact based on our data must encompass results from two purifications (plus repeat purifications, if performed) and integrate reliability scores from all protein identifications by mass spectrometry. Removed from consideration as likely nonspecific contaminants were 44 preys detected in $3% of the purifications and nearly all cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits (Supplementary Table S4). Although the cytosolic ribosomes and pre-ribosomes, as well as some associated translation factors, are not represented in the interaction network and protein complexes we subsequently identified, we previously described the interactome for proteins involved in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis22. We initially generated an `intersection data set' of 2,357 protein­ protein interactions based only on proteins identified in at least one purification by both MALDI­TOF mass spectrometry and LC-MS/MS with relatively low thresholds (70%) (Supplementary Table S5). This intersection data set containing 1,210 proteins was of reasonable quality but limited in scope (Fig. 2b). Our second approach added to the intersection data set proteins identified either reciprocally or repeatedly by only a single mass spectrometry method

to generate the `merged data set'. The merged data set containing 2,186 proteins and 5,496 protein­protein interactions (Supplementary Table S6) had better coverage than the intersection network (Fig. 2b). To deal objectively with noise in the raw data and improve precision and recall, we used machine learning algorithms with two rounds of learning. All four classifiers were validated by the hold-out method (66% for training and 33% for testing) and tentimes tenfold cross-validation, which gave similar results. Because our objective was to identify protein complexes, we used the handcurated protein complexes in the MIPS reference database23 as our training set. Our goal was to assign a probability that each pairwise interaction is true based on experimental reproducibility and mass spectrometry scores from the relevant purifications (see Methods). In the first round of learning, we tested bayesian inference networks and 28 different kinds of decision trees24, settling on bayesian networks and C4.5-based and boosted stump decision trees as providing the most reliable predictions (Fig. 2a). We then improved performance by using the output of the three methods as input for a second round of learning with a stacking algorithm in which logistic regression was the learner25. We used a probability cut-off of 0.273 (average 0.68; median 0.69) to define a `core' data set of 7,123 protein­protein interactions involving 2,708 proteins (Supplementary Table S7) and a cut-off of 0.101 (average 0.42; median 0.27) for an `extended' data set of 14,317 protein­protein interactions involving 3,672 proteins (Supplementary Table S8). The interaction probabilities in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8 are likely to be underestimated because the MIPS complexes used as a `gold standard' are themselves imperfect26. We subsequently used the core protein­protein interaction data set to define protein complexes (see below), but the extended data set probably contains at least 1,000 correct interactions (as well as many more false interactions) not present in the core data set. The complete set of protein­protein interactions and their associated probabilities (Supplementary Table S9) were used to generate a ROC curve with a performance (area under the curve) of 0.95 (Fig. 2b). Predictive sensitivity (true positive rate) or specificity (false positive rate), or both, are superior for our learned data set than for the intersection and merged data sets, each previous high-throughput study of yeast protein­protein interactions11­14, or a bayesian combination of the data from all these studies27 (Fig. 2b).
Identification of complexes within the interaction network In the protein interaction network generated by our core data set of 7,123 protein­protein interactions, the average degree (number of

interactions per protein) is 5.26 and the distribution of the number of interactions per protein follows an inverse power law (Fig. 2c), indicating scale-free network topology28. These protein­protein interactions could be represented as a weighted graph (not shown) in which individual proteins are nodes and the weight of the arc connecting two nodes is the probability that interaction is correct. Because the 2,357 successful purifications underlying such a graph would represent .50% of the detectably expressed proteome18, we have typically purified multiple subunits of a given complex. To identify highly connected modules within the global protein­protein interaction network, we used the Markov cluster algorithm, which simulates random walks within graphs29. We chose values for the expansion and inflation operators of the Markov cluster procedure that optimized overlap with the hand-curated MIPS complexes23. Although the Markov cluster algorithm displays good convergence and robustness, it does not necessarily separate two or more complexes that have shared subunits (for example, RNA polymerases I and III, or chromatin modifying complexes Rpd3C(S) and Rpd3C(L))30,31. The Markov cluster procedure identified 547 distinct (nonoverlapping) heteromeric protein complexes (Supplementary Table S10), about half of which are not present in MIPS or two previous high-throughput studies of yeast complexes using affinity purification and mass spectrometry (Fig. 3a). New subunits or interacting proteins were identified for most complexes that had been identified previously (Fig. 3a). Overlap of our Markov-clustercomputed complexes with the MIPS complexes was evaluated (see Supplementary Information) by calculating the total precision (measure of the extent to which proteins belonging to one reference MIPS complex are grouped within one of our complexes, and vice versa) and homogeneity (measure of the extent to which proteins from the same MIPS complex are distributed across our complexes, and vice versa) (Fig. 3b). Both precision and homogeneity were higher for the complexes generated in this study--even for the extended set of protein­protein interactions--than for complexes generated by both previous high-throughput studies of yeast complexes, perhaps because the increased number of successful purifications in this study increased the density of connections within most modules. The average number of different proteins per complex is 4.9, but the distribution (Fig. 3c), which follows an inverse power law, is characterized by a large number of small complexes, most often containing only two to four different polypeptides, and a much smaller number of very large complexes. Proteins in the same complex should have similar function and colocalize to the same subcellular compartment. To evaluate this, we

calculated the weighted average of the fraction of proteins in each complex that maps to the same localization categories5 (see Supplementary Information). Co-localization was better for the complexes in our study than for previous high-throughput studies but, not unexpectedly, less than that for the curated MIPS complexes (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also evaluated the extent of semantic similarity32 for the GO terms in the `biological process' category for pairs of interacting proteins within our complexes (Supplementary Fig. S2), and found that semantic similarity was lower for our core data set than for the MIPS complexes or the previous study using TAP tags13, but higher than for a study using protein overproduction14. This might be expected if the previous TAP tag study significantly influenced the semantic classifications in GO. To analyse and visualize our entire collection of complexes, the highly connected modules identified by Markov clustering for the global core protein­protein interaction network were displayed (http://genepro.ccb.sickkids.ca) using our GenePro plug-in for the Cytoscape software environment33 (Fig. 3d). Each complex is represented as a pie-chart node, and the complexes are connected by a limited number (429) of high-confidence interactions. Assignment of connecting proteins to a particular module can therefore be arbitrary, and the limited number of connecting proteins could just as well be part of two or more distinct complexes.

The size and colour of each section of a pie-chart node can be made to represent the fraction of the proteins in each complex that maps into a given complex from the hand-curated MIPS complexes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar displays can be generated when highlighting instead the subcellular localizations or GO biological process functional annotations of proteins in each complex. Furthermore, the protein­protein interaction details of individual complexes can readily be visualized (see Supplementary Information).
Evolutionary conservation of protein complexes ORFs encoding each protein were placed into nine distinct evolutionary groups (Fig. 3f) based on their taxonomic profiles (see Methods), and the complexes displayed so as to show the evolutionary conservation of their components (Fig. 3d). Insets highlight the kinetochore complex required for chromosome segregation and a novel, highly conserved complex involved in degradation of fructose1,6-bisphosphatase. Strong co-evolution was evident for components of some large and essential complexes (for example, 19S and 20S proteasomes involved in protein degradation, the exosome involved in RNA metabolism, and the ARP2/3 complex required for the motility and integrity of cortical actin patches). Conversely, the kinetochore complex, the mediator complex required for regulated transcription, and the RSC complex that remodels chromatin have a

high proportion of fungi-specific subunits. Previous studies have shown that highly connected proteins within a network tend to be more highly conserved17,34, a consequence of either functional constraints or preferential interaction of new proteins with existing highly connected proteins28. For the network as a whole, and consistent with earlier studies, Fig. 3e reveals that the frequency of ORFs with a large number (.10) of connections is proportional to the relative distance of the evolutionary group. `Betweenness' provides a measure of how `central' a protein is in a network, typically calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs passing through a node of interest. Figure 3e shows that highly conserved proteins tend to have higher values of betweenness. Despite these average network properties, the subunits of some complexes (for example, the kinetochore complex) display a high degree of connectedness despite restriction to hemiascomycetes. These findings suggest caution in extrapolating network properties to the properties of individual complexes. We also investigated the relationship between an ORF's essentiality and its conservation, degree of connectivity and betweenness (Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistent with previous studies17,35, essential genes tend to be more highly conserved, highly connected and central to the network (as defined by betweenness), presumably reflecting their integrating role.
Examples of new protein complexes and interactions Among the 275 complexes not in MIPS that we identified three are shown in Fig. 4a. One contains Tbf1, Vid22 and YGR071C. Tbf1 binds subtelomeric TTAGGG repeats and insulates adjacent genes from telomeric silencing36,37, suggesting that this trimeric complex might be involved in this process. Consistent with this, a hypomorphic DAmP allele10 (3 0 untranslated region (UTR) deletion) of the essential TBF1 gene causes a synthetic growth defect when combined with a deletion of VID22 (data not shown), suggesting that Tbf1 and Vid22 have a common function. Vid22 and YGR071C are the only yeast proteins containing BED Zinc-finger domains, thought to mediate DNA binding or protein­protein interactions38, suggesting that each uses its BED domain to interact with Tbf1 or enhance DNA binding by Tbf1. Another novel complex in Fig. 4a contains Vid30 and six other subunits (also see Fig. 3d inset). Five of its subunits (Vid30, Vid28, Vid24, Fyv10, YMR135C) have been genetically linked to proteasome-dependent, catabolite-induced degradation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase39, suggesting that the remaining two subunits (YDL176W, YDR255C), hypothetical proteins of hitherto unknown function, are probably involved in the same process. Vid24 was reported to be in a complex with a M r of approximately 600,000 (ref. 39), similar to the sum of the apparent M r values of the subunits of the Vid30-containing complex. The third novel complex contains Rtt109 and Vps75. Because Vps75 is related to nucleosome assembly protein Nap1, and Rtt109 is involved in Ty transposition40, this complex may be involved in chromatin assembly or function. Our systematic characterization of complexes by TAP and mass spectrometry has often led to the identification of new components of established protein complexes (Fig. 3a)41­43. Figure 4 highlights Iwr1 (YDL115C), which co-purifies with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) along with general initiation factor TFIIF and transcription elongation factors Spt4/Spt5 and Dst1 (TFIIS) (Figs 4b and 3d (inset); see also Supplementary Fig. S5a). We used synthetic genetic array (SGA) technology9 in a quantified, high-density E-MAP format10 to systematically identify synthetic genetic interactions for iwr1D with deletions of the elongation factor gene DST1, the SWR complex that assembles the variant histone Htz1 into chromatin44, an Rpd3-containing histone deacetylase complex (Rpd3(L)) that mediates promoter-specific transcriptional repression30,31, the histone H3 K4 methyltransferase complex (COMPASS), the activity of which is linked to elongation by RNAPII45, and other transcriptionrelated genes (Fig. 4c). Moreover, DNA microarray analyses of the effects on gene expression of deletions of IWR1 and other genes
642

involved in transcription by RNAPII, followed by clustering of the genes according to the similarity of their effects on gene expression, revealed that deletion of IWR1 is most similar in its effects on mRNA levels to deletion of RPB4 (Fig. 4d), a subunit of RNAPII with multiple roles in transcription46. We also made use of the fact that Iwr1 is highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. S5b), with a homologue, CG10528, in Drosophila melanogaster. Fig. 4e shows that Drosophila Iwr1 partly co-localizes with phosphorylated, actively transcribing RNAPII on polytene chromosomes, suggesting that Iwr1 is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor.
Conclusions We have described the interactome and protein complexes underlying most of the yeast proteome. Our results comprise 7,123 protein­protein interactions for 2,708 proteins in the core data set. Greater coverage and accuracy were achieved compared with previous high-throughput studies of yeast protein­protein interactions as a consequence of four aspects of our approach: first, unlike a previous study using affinity purification and mass spectrometry14, we avoided potential artefacts caused by protein overproduction; second, we were able to ensure greater data consistency and reproducibility by systematically tagging and purifying both interacting partners for each protein­protein interaction; third, we enhanced coverage and reproducibility, especially for proteins of lower abundance, by using two independent methods of sample preparation and complementary mass spectrometry procedures for protein identification (in effect, up to four spectra were available for statistically evaluating the validity of each PPI); and finally, we used rigorous computational procedures to assign confidence values to our predictions. It is important to note, however, that our data represent a `snapshot' of protein­protein interactions and complexes in a particular yeast strain subjected to particular growth conditions. Both the quality of the mass spectrometry spectra used for protein identification and the approximate stoichiometry of the interacting protein partners can be evaluated by accessing our publicly available comprehensive database (http://tap.med.utoronto.ca/) that reports gel images, protein identifications, protein­protein interactions and supporting mass spectrometry data (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. S6). Soon to be linked to our database will be thousands of sites of post-translational modification tentatively identified during our LC-MS/MS analyses (manuscript in preparation). The protein interactions and assemblies we identified provide entry points for studies on individual gene products, many of which are evolutionarily conserved, as well as `systems biology' approaches to cell physiology in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms. METHODS
Experimental procedures and mass spectrometry. Proteins were tagged, purified and prepared for mass spectrometry as previously described43. Gel images, mass spectra and confidence scores for protein identification by mass spectrometry are found in our database (http://tap.med.utoronto.ca/). Confidence scores for protein identification by LC-MS/MS were calculated as described previously43. After processing 72 database searches for each spectrum, a score of 1.25, corresponding to 99% confidence (A.P.T. and N.J.K, unpublished data), was used as a cut-off for protein identification by MALDI­TOF mass spectrometry. Synthetic genetic interactions and effects of deletion mutations on gene expression were identified as described previously30. Drosophila polytene chromosomes were stained with dIwr1 anti-peptide antibody and H5 monoclonal antibody as previously described47. Identification of protein complexes. Details of the methods for identification of protein complexes and calculating their overlaps with various data sets are described in Supplementary Information. Protein property analysis. We used previously published yeast protein localization data5,6, and yeast protein properties were obtained from the SGD (http:// www.yeastgenome.org/) and GO (http://www.geneontology.org) databases. Proteins expressed at high, medium or low levels have expression log values of .4, 3­4, or ,3, respectively18. Phylogenetic analysis. For each S. cerevisiae sequence a BLAST and TBLASTX

search was performed against each of the different organism data sets, including predicted ORFs from fully sequenced genomes, expressed sequence tag consensus sequences (obtained from http://www.partigenedb.org) and some raw genomic sequences. Using a BLAST bit score cut-off of 50, a taxonomic profile for each ORF was obtained by identifying sequences sharing significant similarity to at least one organism from each group. An ORF is said to be specific to each group only if it has a match to an organism within that group and not to any organism deemed to be more distantly related. Values of betweenness were calculated using the software Pajek (http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/ pajek/).
