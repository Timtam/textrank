Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour1±3. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70±80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it4,5. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date6±12 allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classi®cation to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases (`poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identi®es tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and
530

angiogenesis. This gene expression pro®le will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our ®ndings provide a strategy to select patients who would bene®t from adjuvant therapy. We selected 98 primary breast cancers: 34 from patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years, 44 from patients who continued to be disease-free after a period of at least 5 years, 18 from patients with BRCA1 germline mutations, and 2 from BRCA2 carriers. All `sporadic' patients were lymph node negative, and under 55 years of age at diagnosis. From each patient, 5 mg total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tumour material and used to derive complementary RNA (cRNA). A reference cRNA pool was made by pooling equal amounts of cRNA from each of the sporadic carcinomas. Two hybridizations were carried out for each tumour using a ¯uorescent dye reversal technique on microarrays containing approximately 25,000 human genes synthesized by inkjet technology13. Fluorescence intensities of scanned images were quanti®ed, normalized and corrected to yield the transcript abundance of a gene as an intensity ratio with respect to that of the signal of the reference pool14. Some 5,000 genes were signi®cantly regulated across the group of samples (that is, at least a twofold difference and a P-value of less than 0.01 in more than ®ve tumours). An unsupervised, hierarchical clustering algorithm allowed us to cluster the 98 tumours on the basis of their similarities measured over these approximately 5,000 signi®cant genes. Similarly, the ,5,000 genes were clustered on the basis of their similarities measured over the group of 98 tumours (Fig. 1a). In the dendrograms shown in Fig. 1a (left and top), the length and the subdivision of the branches displays the relatedness of the breast tumours (left) and the expression of the genes (top). Two distinct groups of tumours are the dominant feature in this two-dimensional display (top and bottom of plot, representing 62 and 36 tumours, respectively), suggesting that the tumours can be divided into two types on the basis of this set of ,5,000 signi®cant genes. Notably, in the upper group only 34% of the sporadic patients were from the group who developed distant metastases within 5 years, whereas in the lower group 70% of the sporadic patients had progressive disease (Fig. 1b). Thus, using unsupervised clustering we can already, to some extent, distinguish between `good prognosis' and `poor prognosis' tumours. To gain insight into the genes of the dominant expression signatures, we associated them with histopathological data; for example, oestrogen receptor (ER)-a expression as determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (Fig. 1b). Out of 39 IHCstained tumours negative for ER-a expression (ER negative), 34 clustered together in the bottom branch of the tumour dendrogram. In the enlargement shown in Fig. 1c, a group of downregulated genes is represented containing both the ER-a gene (ESR1) and genes that are apparently co-regulated with ER, some of which are known ER target genes. A second dominant gene cluster is associated with lymphocytic in®ltrate and includes several genes expressed primarily by B and T cells (Fig. 1d). Sixteen out of eighteen tumours of BRCA1 carriers are found in the bottom branch intermingled with sporadic tumours. This is consistent with the idea that most BRCA1 mutant tumours are ER negative and manifest a higher amount of lymphocytic in®ltrate15. The two tumours of BRCA2 carriers are part of the upper cluster of tumours and do not show similarity with BRCA1 tumours. Neither high histological grade nor angioinvasion is a speci®c feature of either of the clusters (Fig. 1b). We conclude that unsupervised clustering detects two subgroups of breast cancers, which differ in ER status and lymphocytic in®ltration. A similar conclusion has also been reported previously7,16. The 78 sporadic lymph-node-negative patients were selected speci®cally to search for a prognostic signature in their gene expression pro®les. Forty-four patients remained free of disease

after their initial diagnosis for an interval of at least 5 years (good prognosis group, mean follow-up of 8.7 years), and 34 patients had developed distant metastases within 5 years (poor prognosis group, mean time to metastases 2.5 years) (Fig. 2a). To identify reliably good and poor prognostic tumours, we used a powerful three-step supervised classi®cation method, similar to those used previously8,17,18. In brief, approximately 5,000 genes (signi®cantly regulated in more than 3 tumours out of 78) were selected from the 25,000 genes on the microarray. The correlation coef®cient of the expression for each gene with disease outcome was calculated and 231 genes were found to be signi®cantly associated with disease outcome (correlation coef®cient ,-0.3 or .0.3). In the second step, these 231 genes were rank-ordered on the basis of the magnitude of the correlation coef®cient. Third, the number of genes in the `prognosis classi®er' was optimized by sequentially adding subsets of 5 genes from the top of this rank-ordered list and

evaluating its power for correct classi®cation using the `leave-oneout' method for cross-validation (see Supplementary Information). Classi®cation was made on the basis of the correlations of the expression pro®le of the `leave-one-out' sample with the mean expression levels of the remaining samples from the good and the poor prognosis patients, respectively. The accuracy improved until the optimal number of marker genes was reached (70 genes). The expression pattern of the 70 genes in the 78 samples is shown in the colour plot of Fig. 2b (left panel), where tumours were ordered by rank according to their correlation coef®cients with the average good prognosis pro®le (Fig. 2b, middle panel). The classi®er predicted correctly the actual outcome of disease for 65 out of the 78 patients (83%), with respectively 5 poor prognosis and 8 good prognosis patients assigned to the opposite category (Fig. 2b, threshold `optimal accuracy', solid line). However, for the selection of patients eligible for adjuvant systemic therapy, a lower number of poor prognosis patients assigned to the good prognosis category should be attained. For this purpose, we set a threshold that resulted in misclassi®cation of no more than 10% of the poor prognosis patients (3 patients out of 34 of the poor prognosis group). This optimized sensitivity threshold resulted in a total of 15 misclassi®cations: 3 poor prognosis tumours were classi®ed as good prognosis, and 12 good prognosis tumours were classi®ed as poor prognosis (Fig. 2b, dashed line). We classi®ed tumours having a gene expression pro®le with a correlation coef®cient above the `optimized sensitivity' threshold (dashed line) as a good prognosis

signature, and below this threshold as a poor prognosis signature. Even small primary tumours without lymph node metastases can display the poor prognosis signature, indicating that they are already programmed for this metastatic phenotype. The functional annotation for the genes provides insight into the underlying biological mechanism leading to rapid metastases. Genes involved in cell cycle, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction are signi®cantly upregulated in the poor prognosis signature (for example cyclin E2, MCM6, metalloproteinases MMP9 and MP1, RAB6B, PK428, ESM1, and the VEGF receptor FLT1; see Fig. 2b). If we evaluate all 231 prognostic reporter genes, more genes belonging to these functional categories become apparent (for example, RAD21, cyclin B2, PCTAIRE, CDC25B, CENPF, VEGF, PGK1, MAD2, CKS2, BUB1) (for a complete list, see Supplementary Information Table S2). Many clinical studies have correlated alterations in expression of individual genes with breast cancer disease outcome, often with contradictory results. Examples include cyclin D1, ER-a, UPA, PAI-1, HER2/neu and c-myc19±22. Surprisingly, none of these genes are present in our set of 70 marker genes. This could be due to the fact that here we determine gene expression at the level of transcription, whereas most previous studies measured protein levels. However, it is more likely that these genes in isolation have only limited predictive power, which highlights the need for an approach based on many genes. To validate the prognosis classi®er, an additional independent set of primary tumours from 19 young, lymph-node-negative breast cancer patients was selected. This group consisted of 7 patients who remained metastasis free for at least ®ve years, and 12 patients who developed distant metastases within ®ve years. The disease outcome was predicted by the 70-gene classi®er and resulted in 2 out of 19 incorrect classi®cations using both the optimal accuracy threshold (Fig. 2c, solid line) and the optimized sensitivity threshold (Fig. 2c, dashed line). Thus, the classi®er showed a comparable performance on the validation set of 19 independent sporadic tumours and con®rmed the predictive power and robustness of prognosis classi®cation using the 70 optimal marker genes (Fisher's exact test for association P = 0.0018). The prediction of the classi®er presented in Fig. 2b would indicate that women under 55 years of age who are diagnosed with lymphnode-negative breast cancer that has a poor prognosis signature have a 28-fold odds ratio (OR) (95% con®dence interval, CI 7±107, P = 1.0 ´ 10-8) to develop a distant metastasis within 5 years compared with those that have the good prognosis signature (see Methods for odds ratio de®nition). This estimate, however, is based on the same series of patients that the classi®er was derived from, and therefore this odds ratio represents an upper limit. A performance cross-validation procedure, in which the leave-one-out sample is not involved in selecting the prognosis reporter genes and the number of reporter genes is not optimized, results in an odds ratio of 15 for a short interval to metastases (95% CI 4±56, P = 4.1 ´ 10-6) (see Supplementary Information). This crossvalidated predictive value of our classi®er is superior to the currently available clinical and histopathological prognostic factors: high grade (odds ratio, OR = 6.4 (95% CI 2.1±19), P = 0.0008), tumour size greater than 2 cm (OR = 4.4 (95% CI 1.7±11), P = 0.0028), angioinvasion (OR = 4.2 (95% CI 1.5±12), P = 0.01), age #40 (OR = 3.7 (95% CI 1.3±11), P = 0.02), and ER negative (OR = 2.4 (95% CI 0.9±6.6), P = 0.13). Furthermore, the evaluation of the cross-validated classi®er in a multivariate model that includes all classical prognostic factors indicates that it is an independent factor in predicting outcome of disease (logistic regression OR = 18 (3.3±94), P-value of likelihood ratio test 1.4 ´ 10-4). Studying a large and unselected cohort of breast cancer patients is required to provide a more accurate estimate of the metastatic risk associated with the prognosis signature. Unsupervised cluster analysis distinguishes between ER-positive
534

and ER-negative tumours (Fig. 1a). To investigate the expression patterns associated with the immunohistochemical staining of ER and to explore the differences between the sporadic and BRCA1 tumours that fall into the ER-negative cluster (Fig. 1a), a supervised two-layer classi®cation was performed (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b shows that 550 genes optimally report the dominant pattern associated with ER status, including genes such as keratin 18, BCL2, ERBB3 and ERBB4 (see Supplementary Information Table S3). The leaveone-out analysis shows that only two ER-positive and three ERnegative tumours (as determined by IHC) were classi®ed in the opposite gene expression group (95% correct classi®cation, Fig. 3b, middle panel). However, in all ®ve discordant cases, the abundance of ER messenger RNA measured by the microarray agrees with the classi®cation (Fig. 3b, right panel). An ER status reporter signature was also determined by others using a similar classi®cation method8, and their ER signature gene set overlaps with ours (21 out of their 50 ER status reporter genes are present in our set of 550 ER reporters). Our observation in the unsupervised analysis that ER clustering has predictive power for prognosis is also valid for the ER supervised classi®cation, although it does not reach the level of signi®cance of the prognosis classi®er (ER signature prediction for prognosis, OR = 3.7 (95% CI 1.3±11) P = 0.02; data not shown). Figure 3c shows the leave-one-out classi®cation of the 38 ERnegative tumours into sporadic cases and BRCA1-associated cases based on an optimal set of 100 genes. This set is enriched in lymphocyte-speci®c genes (see Supplementary Information Table S4). The classi®cation into sporadic and BRCA1 tumours was caused mainly by the differences in levels of gene expression (amplitude), in concordance with recent ®ndings that BRCA1 mediates ligand-independent transcriptional repression of the ER23 (95% accuracy, 2/38 misclassi®ed, Fig. 3c). The one sporadic tumour that was classi®ed as a BRCA1 tumour was shown to contain methylation of the BRCA1 promoter, indicating an epigenetic modi®cation of BRCA124 (data not shown). Notably, the discordant BRCA1 tumour is from a patient where the germline mutation has only altered the last 29 amino acids of the BRCA1 protein (BRCA1 mutation 5,622del62), which abolishes transcriptional activation by BRCA125). One previous study de®ned a gene expression signature associated with BRCA1 germline mutations using a panel of seven tumours26; however, the study was unable to appreciate the overlap in signatures between the ER-negative and BRCA1 tumours. Furthermore, the nine BRCA1 status reporter genes26 were not present in our set of 100 optimal reporter genes. The two-layer cluster analysis that we have used and the larger number of tumours we analysed may account for these differences. Our results indicate that breast cancer prognosis can already be derived from the gene expression pro®le of the primary tumour. Recent consensus conferences on treatment of breast cancer in Europe and the USA (St. Gallen2 and NIH consensus3) have developed guidelines for the eligibility of adjuvant chemotherapy based on histological and clinical characteristics. Following these

guidelines, up to 90% of lymph-node-negative young breast cancer patients are candidates for adjuvant systemic treatment. As 70±80% of these patients would not have developed distant metastases without adjuvant treatment, these patients may not bene®t from the treatment, and may potentially suffer from the side effects. We applied the St Gallen and NIH consensus criteria on our patient group to compare the ef®cacy of the microarray classi®er for the selection of patients for adjuvant systemic treatment. Table 1 shows that the prognosis classi®er selects just as effectively those high-risk patients that would bene®t from adjuvant therapy, but signi®cantly reduces the number of patients that receive unnecessary treatment. Thus, the prognostic pro®le potentially provides a powerful tool to tailor adjuvant systemic treatment that could greatly reduce the cost of breast cancer treatment, both in terms of adverse side effects and health care expenditure. Furthermore, the signature that de®nes ER status can be used to decide on adjuvant hormonal therapy, and the signature that reveals BRCA1 status may further improve the diagnosis of hereditary breast cancer. Finally, genes that are overexpressed in tumours with a poor prognosis pro®le are potential targets for the rational development of new cancer drugs. Identi®cation of such targets may improve the ef®ciency of developing M therapeutics for many tumour types.
oligonucleotide chosen by the oligonucleotide probe design programme13. After hybridization, slides were washed and scanned using a confocal laser scanner (Agilent Technologies).

Method of unsupervised two-dimensional clustering
In the two-dimensional cluster analysis, gene clustering and tumour clustering were performed independently using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. For gene clustering, pairwise similarity metrics among genes are calculated on the basis of expression ratio measurements across all tumours. Similarly, for tumour clustering, pairwise similarity measures among tumours are calculated based on expression ratio measurements across all signi®cant genes (for details see Supplementary Information).

Method of supervised classi®cation
We developed a method for classifying breast tumours into prognostic or diagnostic categories based on gene expression pro®les. This method includes the following three steps: (1) selection of discriminating candidate genes by their correlation with the category; (2) determination of the optimal set of reporter genes using a leave-one-out cross validation procedure; (3) prognostic or diagnostic prediction based on the gene expression of the optimal set of reporter genes (for details see Supplementary Information).

Statistical analysis
The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds in favour of developing distant metastases within 5 years for a patient in this study with a tumour characterized by the poor prognosis signature, to the odds in favour of developing metastases without this signature (2 ´ 2 table). P-values associated with odds ratios are calculated by Fisher's exact test. In the multivariate analysis a logistic model was applied with outcome of disease as the dependent variable, and the P-value for the relevant parameter is derived from the likelihood ratio test in the model (see Supplementary Information).

Methods
Breast tumour selection criteria
The criteria for the sporadic patients (n = 97) were: primary invasive breast carcinoma less than 5 cm (T1 or T2), no axillary metastases (N0), age at diagnosis less than 55 years, calendar year of diagnosis 1983±1996, no previous malignancies; all patients were treated by modi®ed radical mastectomy (n = 35) or breast-conserving treatment (n = 62), including axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy. Five patients of the metastases group received adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of chemotherapy (n = 3) or hormonal therapy (n = 2), all other patients did not receive additional treatment. All patients were followed at least annually for a period of at least 5 years. The criteria for hereditary patients (n = 20) were: carriers of a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and primary invasive breast carcinoma; no other selection criterion was applied. This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute. For complete patient data, see Table S1 in Supplementary Information.

Clinical parameters of breast tumours
Tumour material was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 h after surgery. A haematoxylin and eosin stained section was prepared before and after cutting slides for RNA isolation for assessment of the percentage of tumour cells. Only samples with greater than 50% tumour cells were selected, mean 67% and median 70% for all groups studied. Formalin-®xed, paraf®n-embedded tumour tissue was used to evaluate the following: tumour type (according to the World Health Organisation classi®cation), histological grade (grade 1±3), and the presence of angioinvasive growth and extensive lymphocytic in®ltrate. ER expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining (negative when less than 10% of the nuclei showed staining, all others ER positive).

RNA isolation
We used 30 sections of 30-mm thickness for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated with RNAzolB, and ®nally dissolved in RNase-free H2O. Twenty-®ve micrograms of total RNA was treated with DNase using the Qiagen RNase-free DNase kit and RNeasy spin columns. Total RNA treated with DNase was dissolved in RNase-free H2O to a ®nal concentration of 0.2 mg ml-1.

cRNA labelling
cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase on 5 mg total RNA and labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 (CyDye, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)13. Five micrograms of Cy-labelled cRNA from one breast cancer tumour was mixed with the same amount of reverse colour Cy-labelled product from a pool, which consisted of an equal amount of cRNA from each individual sporadic patient.

Expression pro®ling using microarray
Labelled cRNAs were fragmented to an average size of approximately 50±100 nucleotides by heating at 60 8C in the presence of 10 mM ZnCl2, added to a hybridization buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 0.5% sodium sarcosine, 50 mM MES, pH 6.5, and formamide to a ®nal concentration of 30%, ®nal volume 3 ml at 40 8C. Hu25K microarrays represented the 24,479 biological oligonucleotides plus 1,281 control probes. Sequences for microarrays were selected from RefSeq (a collection of non-redundant mRNA sequences; http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/refseq.html) and from expressed sequence tag (EST) contigs (http://www.phrap.org/est_assembly/human/gene_number_methods.html). Each mRNA or EST contig was represented on the Hu25K microarray by a single 60-polymer

Activation of naive CD4+ T-helper cells results in the development of at least two distinct effector populations, Th1 and Th2 cells1±3. Th1 cells produce cytokines (interferon (IFN)-g, interleukin (IL)2, tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-a and lymphotoxin) that are commonly associated with cell-mediated immune responses against intracellular pathogens, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions4, and induction of organ-speci®c autoimmune diseases5. Th2 cells produce cytokines (IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) that are crucial for control of extracellular helminthic infections and promote atopic and allergic diseases4. Although much is known about the functions of these two subsets of T-helper cells, there are few known surface molecules that distinguish between them6. We report here the identi®cation and characterization of a transmembrane protein, Tim-3, which contains an immunoglobulin and a mucin-like domain and is expressed on differentiated Th1 cells. In vivo administration of antibody to Tim-3 enhances the clinical and pathological severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a Th1-dependent autoimmune disease, and increases the number and activation level of macrophages. Tim-3 may have an important role in the induction of autoimmune diseases by regulating macrophage activation and/or function. In addition to their distinct roles in disease, Th1 and Th2 cells cross-regulate each other's expansion and functions. Thus, preferential induction of Th2 cells inhibits autoimmune diseases7,8, and

predominant induction of Th1 cells can regulate induction of asthma, atopy and allergies9,10. Several groups have reported the association of chemokine and co-stimulatory receptors with Th1 (refs 11±14) and Th2 (refs 12, 13, 15±18) cells; however, the nature of the differences in expression of most of these molecules is quantitative. To identify new Th1-speci®c cell surface proteins, we immunized Lewis and Lou/M rats with Th1 T-cell clones and lines, including the established Th1-speci®c clone AE7 and in vitro differentiated Th1 cell lines derived from 5B6 (ref. 19) and DO11.10 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice. A panel of approximately 20,000 monoclonal antibodies was generated and screened on Th1 and Th2 cells. Two of the monoclonal antibodies (8B.2C12 and 25F.1D6) that selectively stained Th1 cells were further characterized. These
