Slatko,3 Hervé Tettelin,1¶ John H. Werren2¶ Although common among bacteria, lateral gene transfer--the movement of genes between distantly related organisms--is thought to occur only rarely between bacteria and multicellular eukaryotes. However, the presence of endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia pipientis, within some eukaryotic germlines may facilitate bacterial gene transfers to eukaryotic host genomes. We therefore examined host genomes for evidence of gene transfer events from Wolbachia bacteria to their hosts. We found and confirmed transfers into the genomes of four insect and four nematode species that range from nearly the entire Wolbachia genome (>1 megabase) to short (<500 base pairs) insertions. Potential Wolbachia-to-host transfers were also detected computationally in three additional sequenced insect genomes. We also show that some of these inserted Wolbachia genes are transcribed within eukaryotic cells lacking endosymbionts. Therefore, heritable lateral gene transfer occurs into eukaryotic hosts from their prokaryote symbionts, potentially providing a mechanism for acquisition of new genes and functions.

in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity, and metabolic pathways (1). Rare LGT events have also been identified between higher eukaryotes with segregated germ cells (2), demonstrating that even these organisms can acquire novel DNA. Although most described LGT events occur within a single domain of life, LGT has been described both between Eubacteria and Archaea (3) and between prokaryotes and phagotrophic unicellular eukaryotes (4, 5). However, few interdomain transfers involving higher multicellular eukaryotes have been found. Wolbachia pipientis is a maternally inherited endosymbiont that infects a wide range of

Widespread Lateral Gene Transfer from Intracellular Bacteria to Multicellular Eukaryotes

arthropods, including at least 20% of insect species, as well as filarial nematodes (6). It is present in developing gametes (6) and so provides circumstances conducive for heritable transfer of bacterial genes to the eukaryotic hosts. Wolbachia-host transfer has been described in the bean beetle Callosobruchus chinensis (7) and in the filarial nematode Onchocerca spp. (8). We have found Wolbachia inserts in the genomes of additional diverse invertebrate taxa, including fruit flies, wasps, and nematodes. A comparison of the published genome of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (9) and assemblies of Wolbachia clone mates (10) from fruit fly whole-genome shotgun sequencing data revealed a large Wolbachia insert in the genome of the widespread tropical fruit fly D. ananassae. Numerous contiguous, overlapping, clone sequences (contigs) were found that harbored junctions between Drosophila retrotransposons and Wolbachia genes. The large number of these junctions and the deep sequencing coverage across the junctions indicated that these inserts were probably not due to chimeric libraries or assemblies. To validate these observations, we amplified five DrosophilaWolbachia junctions with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and verified the end sequences for three of them. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of banded polytene chromosomes with fluorescein-labeled probes of two Wolbachia genes (11) revealed the presence of Wolbachia genes on the 2L chromosome of D. ananassae (Fig. 1). We found that nearly the entire Wolbachia genome was transferred to the fly nuclear genome, as evidenced by the presence of PCRamplified products from 44 of 45 physically distant Wolbachia genes in cured strains of D. ananassae Hawaii verified by microscopy to be lacking the endosymbiont after treatment with

REPORTS
antibiotics (fig. S1) (11). In contrast, only spurious, incorrectly sized, and weak amplification was detected from a cured control line lacking these inserts (Townsville). The 45 genes assayed (table S1) are spaced throughout the Wolbachia genome. Thus, the high proportion of amplified genes suggests gene transfer of nearly the entire Wolbachia genome to the insect genome. A 14-kb region containing four Wolbachia genes with two retrotransposon insertions was sequenced (11) from a single bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC), constituting an independent source of DNA as compared with the largely plasmid-derived whole-genome sequence of D. ananassae. The two retroelements each contained 5­base pair (bp) target site duplications (9/10 bp identical), long terminal repeats, and gag-pol genes (Fig. 2A) indicating that the Wolbachia insert is accumulating retroelements. Insertion of this region appears to be recent, as shown by the nearly identical target site duplications and the >90% nucleotide identity between corresponding endosymbiont genes and sequenced homologs in the D. ananassae chromosome. Crosses between Wolbachia-free Hawaii males (with the insert) and Wolbachia-free Mexico females (without the insert) revealed that the insert is paternally inherited by offspring of both sexes, confirming that Wolbachia genes are inserted into an autosome. Because Wolbachia infections are maternally inherited, this also confirms that PCR amplification in the antibiotictreated line is not due to an undetectable infection. Furthermore, the Hawaii and Mexico crosses revealed Mendelian, autosomal inheritance of Wolbachia inserts [paternal N = 57, proportion of offspring with Wolbachia genes (k) = 0.49; maternal N = 40, k = 0.58]. Six physically distant, inserted Wolbachia genes perfectly cosegregated in F2 maternal inheritance crosses (11), suggesting they also are closely linked. PCR amplification and sequencing (11) of 45 Wolbachia loci in 14 D. ananassae lines from widely dispersed geographic locations revealed large Wolbachia inserts in lines from Hawaii, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India (table S2). Sequence comparisons of the amplicons from these four lines revealed that all open reading frames (ORFs) remained intact with >99.9% identity between inserts. This is compared to an average of 97.7% identity for the inserts compared with wMel, the Wolbachia endosymbiont of D. melanogaster. These results indicate the widespread prevalence of D. ananassae strains with similar inserts of the Wolbachia genome, probably because of a single insertion from a common ancestor. In addition, reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR) followed by sequencing (11) demonstrated that ~2% of Wolbachia genes (28 of 1206 genes assayed; table S3) are transcribed in cured adult males and females of D. ananassae Hawaii. The complete 5 sequence of one of the transcripts, WD_0336, was obtained with 5-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) on uninfected flies (11), suggesting that this transcript has a 5 mRNA cap, a form of eukaryotic posttranscriptional modification. Analysis of the transcript quantities of inserted Wolbachia genes with quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (11) revealed that they are 104 times to 107 times less abundant than the fly's highly transcribed actin gene (act5C; table S3). There is no cutoff that defines a biologically relevant amount of transcription, and assessment of transcription in whole insects can obscure important tissue-specific transcription. Therefore, it is unclear whether these transcripts are biologically meaningful, and further work is needed to determine their importance. Screening of public shotgun sequencing data sets has identified several additional cases of LGT in different invertebrate species. In Wolbachiacured strains of the wasp Nasonia, six small Wolbachia inserts (<500 bp) were verified by PCR and sequencing (11) that have >96% nucleotide identity to native Wolbachia sequences, in some cases with short insertion site duplications. These include four in Nasonia vitripennis, one in N. giraulti, and one in N. longicornis (table S4 and Fig. 2B). Amplification and sequencing of 14 to 18 geographically diverse strains of each species indicated that the inserts are speciesspecific. For example, three Wolbachia inserts in N. vitripennis are not found in the closely related

Junctions were validated by PCR amplification and sequencing (11), with the number of successful reactions compared to the number attempted. Species marked with a plus sign are described in the literature as being infected with Wolbachia. All whole-genome shotgun sequencing reads were downloaded for 26 arthropod and nematode genomes (11). Organisms identified as lacking Wolbachia sequences either had no match or matches only to the prokaryotic ribosomal RNA. Because the Nasonia genomes are from antibiotic-cured insects, they were identified as having a putative LGT event merely on identification of Wolbachia sequences in a read. All other organisms were considered to have putative LGT events if the trace repository contained 1 read with (i) >80% nucleotide identity over 10% of the read to a characterized eukaryotic gene, (ii) >80% identity over 10% of the read to a Wolbachia gene, and (iii) manual review of the BLAST results for 1 to 20 reads to ensure significance (11).

species N. giraulti or N. longicornis, which diversified ~1 million years ago (12). These data suggest that the Wolbachia gene inserts are of relatively recent origin, similar to the inserts in D. ananassae. Nematode genomes also contain inserted Wolbachia sequences. Because Wolbachia infection is required for fertility and development of the worm Brugia malayi, the genomes of both organisms were sequenced simultaneously, complicating assemblies and leading to the removal of Wolbachia reads during genome assembly [>98% identity over 90% of the read length on the basis of the independent BAC-based genome sequence of wBm, the Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi (13)]. Despite this, the genome of B. malayi contains 249 contigs with Wolbachia sequences (e value < 10-40), nine of which were confirmed by long-range PCR and end-sequencing

(11). These include eight large scaffolds containing >1-kb Wolbachia fragments within 8 kb of a B. malayi gene (table S5). Comparisons of wBm homologs to these regions suggested that all of these Wolbachia genes within the B. malayi genome are degenerate. In addition, a single region <1 kb was examined that contains a degenerate fragment of the Wolbachia aspartate aminotransferase gene (Wbm0002). Its location was confirmed by PCR and sequencing in B. malayi as well as in B. timori and B. pahangi (11). Of the remaining 21 arthropod and nematode genomes in the trace repositories (11), we found six containing Wolbachia sequences. Potential Wolbachia-host LGT was detected in three: D. sechellia, D. simulans, and Culex pipiens (Table 1), as revealed by the presence of reads containing homology to both endosymbiont and host genomes (11).

The sequencing of wBm also facilitated the discovery of a Wolbachia insertion in Dirofilaria immitis (dog heartworm). The D. immitis Dg2 chromosomal region encoding the D34 immunodominant antigen (14, 15) contains Wolbachia DNA within its introns and in the 5 untranslated region (5-UTR) (Fig. 2C). These Wolbachia genomic fragments have maintained synteny with the wBm genome (13), suggesting they may have inserted as a single unit and regions were replaced by exons of Dg2. A second gene (DgK) has been identified in other D. immitis lines that has 91% nucleotide identity in the exon sequences but contains differing number, position, size, and sequence of introns (16) and has no homology to known Wolbachia sequences. Whole eukaryote genome sequencing projects routinely exclude bacterial sequences on the assumption that these represent contamination. For example, the publicly available assembly of D. ananassae does not include any of the Wolbachia sequences described here. Therefore, the argument that the lack of bacterial genes in these assembled genomes indicates that bacterial LGT does not occur is circular and invalid. Recent bacterial LGT to eukaryotic genomes will continue to be difficult to detect if bacterial sequences are routinely excluded from assemblies without experimental verification. And these LGT events will remain understudied despite their potential to provide novel gene functions and affect arthropod and nematode genome evolution. Because W. pipientis is among the most abundant intracellular bacteria (17, 18) and its hosts are among the most abundant animal phyla, the view that prokaryote-to-eukaryote transfers are uncommon and unimportant needs to be reevaluated.

Scott23 Parasitic nematodes that cause elephantiasis and river blindness threaten hundreds of millions of people in the developing world. We have sequenced the ~90 megabase (Mb) genome of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi and predict ~11,500 protein coding genes in 71 Mb of robustly assembled sequence. Comparative analysis with the free-living, model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that, despite these genes having maintained little conservation of local synteny during ~350 million years of evolution, they largely remain in linkage on chromosomal units. More than 100 conserved operons were identified. Analysis of the predicted proteome provides evidence for adaptations of B. malayi to niches in its human and vector hosts and insights into the molecular basis of a mutualistic relationship with its Wolbachia endosymbiont. These findings offer a foundation for rational drug design. he phylum Nematoda is speciose and abundant and, although most species are free-living, many are parasitic. Over onethird of all humans, mainly in the developing world, carry a nematode infection. Parasitic worms typically cause chronic, debilitating infections that are often difficult to treat and that, despite the high cost to human health, have been neglected in biomedical research. Current knowledge of nematode molecular genetics and developmental biology is largely based on extensive studies of the free-living, bacteriovorous species Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we present the initial analysis of the genome of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi. Brugia malayi is endemic in Southeast Asia and Indonesia. Like other filarial nematodes, B. malayi develops through four larval stages into an adult male or female (fig. S1), entirely within one of two host species--a mosquito vector (Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles) and humans, where adult worms can live for more than a decade. B. malayi was chosen for wholegenome sequencing (1) because it is the only

Most filarial nematodes, including B. malayi, carry three genomes: nuclear, mitochondrial (available at GenBank, accession no. AF538716), and that of an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia. We present here the draft assembly and annotated genome of the TRS strain of B. malayi. We provide comparative analyses with Caenorhabditis and another well-annotated member of the superphylum Ecdysozoa, Drosophila melanogaster, to further illuminate the origins of novelty and loss of ancestral characters in the model species and the parasite. Comparative genome analysis reveals key features of Nematoda that define the scope of molecular diversity that has contributed to the success of the phylum. The analysis also uncovers adaptations that appear to have evolved in the B. malayi genome in response to the pressures of parasitism and to the presence of the parasite's Wolbachia endosymbiont, wBm. The B. malayi nuclear genome is organized as five chromosomes (2), including an XY sexVOL 317 SCIENCE

determination pair, and has been estimated to be 80 to 100 megabases (Mb) (3, 4). The sequence of the B. malayi nuclear genome was obtained to ~9× coverage with the use of whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing (1, 5). The sequences were assembled into scaffolds totaling ~71 Mb of data with a further ~17.5 Mb of contigs not integrated into any scaffold (orphan contigs). The repeat content of the B. malayi genome, estimated at ~15% (1), may have contributed significantly to assembly difficulties (5, 6). From these sequence data, we estimate that the B. malayi genome is 90 to 95 Mb (Table 1) (5). In comparison, the C. elegans genome is 100 Mb and the Caenorhabditis briggsae genome 104 Mb. The overall G + C content (30.5%) is lower than that of C. elegans (35.4%) or C. briggsae (37.4%) (6). The complement of protein-coding genes was derived by automated gene prediction from the ~71-Mb assembly and by manual annotation of selected gene families (table S1). The 11,515 robustly predicted gene-coding regions occupy ~32% of the sequence at an average density of 162 genes/Mb (Table 1). After inclusion of genes estimated to be found in the unannotated portion of the genomic sequence (5), we infer that B. malayi has between 14,500 and 17,800 protein-coding genes, agreeing with previous estimates (7). Even the higher estimate is lower than the 19,762 (WormBase data release WS133) and 19,507 (6) genes reported for C. elegans and C. briggsae, respectively, which suggests that parasitic nematode genomes have fewer genes than their free-living counterparts, echoing a pattern observed in bacterial pathogens. For the six scaffolds longer than 1 Mb, totaling ~25 Mb of the genome, the arrangement of B. malayi genes was compared with that of their C. elegans orthologs (Fig. 1). Linkage is in general conserved: For large regions of the B. malayi genome, orthologs map predominantly to one (or, in the case of scaffold 14972, two) C. elegans chromosome(s) (Fig. 1, A to C), which indicates maintenance of linkage of these genes despite ~350 million years of separation (8). However, local gene order is not conserved (Fig. 1D). The largest, 6.5-Mb scaffold contains interdigitating blocks of genes that map to chromosomes 4 and X of C. elegans, which suggests there were ancient breakage and fusion events between linkage groups. These data support a model where within-linkage group rearrangements have been many times more common than between-linkage group transloca-
