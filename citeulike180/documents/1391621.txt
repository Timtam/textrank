interesting features. First, the effective interaction pattern could be modified very dynamically. Second, the mechanism would act connectionwise. Third, a transient interaction would lead to spike-time­dependent plasticity (8­10) and thus, a long-term trace. And fourth, synchronization might emerge in a self-organized manner between "matching" neuronal groups. In the visual cortex, synchronization is stronger among neurons activated by the same visual stimulus (1). This principle might generalize to the handshaking between cognitive top-down control and matching sensory bottom-up information, in which case consecutive synchronization could contribute to the selective routing of sensory information to behavioral control (13, 14, 25). Our results suggest that synchronization has consequences for neuronal interactions, providing a putative mechanism through which synchronization contributes to cognitive functions.

Neural Mechanisms of Visual Attention: How Top-Down Feedback Highlights Relevant Locations
Yuri B. Saalmann,1 Ivan N. Pigarev,2 Trichur R. Vidyasagar1* Attention helps us process potentially important objects by selectively increasing the activity of sensory neurons that represent the relevant locations and features of our environment. This selection process requires top-down feedback about what is important in our environment. We investigated how parietal cortical output influences neural activity in early sensory areas. Neural recordings were made simultaneously from the posterior parietal cortex and an earlier area in the visual pathway, the medial temporal area, of macaques performing a visual matching task. When the monkey selectively attended to a location, the timing of activities in the two regions became synchronized, with the parietal cortex leading the medial temporal area. Parietal neurons may thus selectively increase activity in earlier sensory areas to enable focused spatial attention. ttention allows us to engage with our environment by selecting information relevant for behavior (1­3). This enables preferential processing of particular locations in the visual field or specific features of objects. Attention maintained on a location is usually referred to as spatial attention and that on a

feature as feature-based attention (4, 5). Both types of attention manifest in visual cortical areas as increased activity of neurons representing the attended location or feature and reduced activity of other neurons (6­14). This may require topdown feedback about what is relevant in the environment; however, such feedback has not been empirically demonstrated. There is evidence (6, 11, 15­17) that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is critical for spatial attention. The PPC is a higher-order structure along the dorsal stream of visual areas (Fig. 1A), which are particularly concerned with spatial aspects of a scene. It has been suggested that the spatial information about VOL 316 SCIENCE

a scene extracted by the PPC forms the basis for feedback signals to earlier levels of the visual pathway, highlighting spatial locations of potential interest (18, 19) and gating responses depending upon the state of attention. We simultaneously measured the activity in a part of the macaque PPC called the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), and the immediately earlier stage of the dorsal pathway, the medial temporal area (MT; Fig. 1A). We tested whether LIP feedback increases MT responses to attended visual stimuli. The monkeys performed a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task, which manipulated both where they were attending and what stimulus feature they were attending to (Fig. 1B) (20). We recorded 29 pairs of neurons from MT and LIP, each pair having overlapping receptive fields (RFs) and the same preferred orientation. Local field potentials (LFPs) from the two sites were also recorded. We first tested whether our paradigm resulted in increased responses of MT neurons to attended stimuli. Figure 2A shows the effect of spatial attention on a single MT neuron and Fig. 2B, the average population response. For both data sets, the MT response to the second stimulus was significantly increased in the "spatial and featurebased attention" and "spatial attention" conditions, compared to the "neutral" control. When "attention was elsewhere," the MT response to the second stimulus was significantly reduced (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05). These attentional effects on MT neurons are consistent with those reported in other types of cognitive

tasks and other cortical areas (2, 6­14) and are not due to simple stimulus repetition (fig. S1). If LIP neurons code attention priorities, then their activity should differentiate between attention conditions. Figure 2, C and D, show the activity of a single LIP neuron and the population, respectively. Both show a significantly increased response to the second stimulus with "spatial and feature-based attention" compared to the "neutral" first stimulus, but a significantly reduced response when "attention was elsewhere" (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05). For the "spatial attention" condition, the increased response to the second stimulus was significantly different from the "attention elsewhere" control, though not the "neutral" control. The activity of LIP neurons increased through the delay period after the first stimulus, with the overall delay period activity significantly greater in those cases where attention included the RF location (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05). Because LIP activity increased before the MT response to an attended stimulus, LIP is in a position to provide feedback to MT. If LIP causes the effect of attention on MT, then the activity in the two areas should be correlated and spikes from LIP neurons should be closely followed by spikes from MT neurons. We calculated the coherence of MT and LIP activities [using multi-taper spectral methods (20­22)], which measures the degree of association between two oscillatory processes (here the spike trains or LFPs in MT and LIP), as a function of oscillation frequency. We generally observed increased coherence between MT and LIP LFPs in the "spatial and feature-based attention" and "spatial attention" conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). The coherence in the 10- to 35-Hz range increased when the first stimulus appeared in the RF. It was also significantly elevated during the delay period (Student's t test, P < 0.05), increasing just before the second stimulus. The coherence peaked around the second stimulus and remained elevated for up to 400 ms around the stimulus. Figure 3C shows the coherence when the first stimulus was flashed outside the RF and thus spatial attention was not drawn to the receptive-field location. The coherence is much weaker in this case, particularly around the second stimulus. Figure 3D shows the average coherence of the population of 29 paired recordings for the two attention conditions and two control states. The coherence was significantly greater (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05) when attention was focused on the receptive-field location compared to the "neutral" and "attention elsewhere" controls. The significant coherence of LFPs in MT and LIP during spatial attention means that there was correlated activity between ensembles of MT and LIP neurons. To determine the relative timing of action potentials between the two areas, we calculated the coherence between simultaneously recorded spike trains from single neurons in MT and LIP (0 to 300 ms after stimulus onset). The coherence between the spikes elicited by MT and LIP neurons was generally low but nonetheless significantly above zero (Student's t test, P < 0.1) in the gammafrequency range for 34% of neuron pairs. The lower coherence between spike trains than between LFPs is expected, because any particular sampled pair of neurons has a low probability of being strongly connected. Nevertheless, the "spatial and feature-based attention" and "spatial attention" conditions produced significant coherence (Fig. 4A). In contrast, there were no cases of significant coherence in the "neutral" and "attention elsewhere" controls. If LIP has a top-down influence on MT responses during focal attention, then the phase of the coherence should show LIP leading MT. Figure 4B shows the phase when the coherence was significantly above zero, which occurred only during the two attention conditions. The phase of the peak coherence showed the LIP preceding MT by 4.55 ± 1.04 ms for the "spatial

The monkey is required to match both the orientation and location of two stimulus gratings to obtain a reward. The monkey maintained fixation throughout each trial, while we manipulated his attentional state. Two attention conditions were compared to two controls. When both gratings (S1 and S2) have the neurons' preferred orientation, and both appear at the RF location (here, the lower left quadrant), the period after onset of S2 is the "spatial and feature-based attention" condition (left cascade). When S1 and S2 are both at the RF, but S1 has the nonpreferred orientation and S2 the preferred, the period after onset of S2 is the "spatial attention" condition (middle cascade). The two controls are the "attention elsewhere" state, which is the period after onset of S2 when S1 is outside the RF and preferred-orientation S2 is at the RF (right cascade); and the "neutral" state, the period after onset of S1 when preferred-orientation S1 is at the RF and S2 has not yet been presented (left cascade).

and feature-based attention" condition and by 7.43 ± 2.02 ms for the "spatial attention" condition (mean ± SE of the 34% of neuron pairs showing significant coherence). This phase relationship is physiologically plausible for feedback from the LIP to MT, assuming a conduction velocity of 1 m/s (23) for intracortical connections. To ensure that the coherence we saw was due to within-trial physiological interactions, we shifted, across time, the LIP spike train relative to the MT train by integer multiples of trials for each recording session and recalculated the coherence (Fig. 4C). This control abolished the attention-enhanced coherence. We next tested whether LIP spikes preceded enough MT spikes to cause the increased MT activity during spatial attention. We observed a significant increase in the percentage of MT spikes preceded by LIP spikes in the spatial attention conditions compared with the "neutral" and "attention elsewhere" controls (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05; Fig. 4D). The magnitude of this effect (percentage of MT spikes preceded by LIP spikes within 10 ms: spatial and featural attention, 11.5%; spatial attention, 8.3%) could potentially account for a substantial amount of the increase in MT activity (spatial and featural attention, +14.0%; spatial attention, +9.6%). However, a greater increase in LIP activity, relative to MT activity, could lead to the results in Fig. 4D without LIP feedback to MT. This possibility is discounted by the finding of a significant increase in the percentage of LIP spikes followed by MT spikes with attention (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05; Fig. 4E). Both increased coherence of oscillatory LFPs and LIP spikes preceding MT spikes in the attention conditions are evident in the raw data from single trials (fig. S2). Synchronization between LIP neurons may be a fundamental mechanism ensuring that the output from LIP neurons has an increased impact on sensory areas such as MT. We calculated the spike-field coherence in LIP, which indicates the degree of synchronization between spike times and the LFP. The mean spike-field coherence between 25 and 45 Hz was significantly increased in the two spatial attention conditions (Fig. 4F) compared to the "attention elsewhere" control (Holm's controlled Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05). This suggests that spike timing, in addition to spike rate, may be important for increased efficacy of attentional feedback. Our results show that LIP feedback can account for attention-enhanced MT responses. This feedback manifests in the coherent activities of MTand LIP neurons within the gamma-frequency range (25 to 45 Hz), supporting the role of gamma synchronization in information processing (24­26). The phase of the observed coherence is such that LIP feedback can potentially arrive at MT during a depolarizing phase of membrane-potential oscillations, increasing the probability of spike generation. Synchronization of feedback may also increase sensory activity during attention. The response of LIP neurons to the second stimulus of preferred orientation depended upon whether the first stimulus, though at the same location, was of the preferred or orthogonal orientation. In MT neurons, however, there was no significant difference in response to the second

stimulus between these two attention conditions. This is consistent with the idea that the parietal cortex uses both spatial and feature-based information to determine purely spatial priorities for its feedback (18). Such a scheme provides a neural framework for "guided search" models of attention (3, 18) and is consistent with feedback to auditory and somatosensory systems (27, 28) being spatial. The dorsal and ventral cortical pathways are said to represent the spatial and feature-based aspects of a visual scene, respectively, and LIP is part of the dorsal pathway. However, the feature selectivity shown by LIP neurons in our and other studies (29, 30) means that LIP could be involved in processing object features through its direct connections with the ventral pathway (19, 27, 28) or by gating neuronal activity at the level of V1 via MT (18, 19). The attentional modulation of activity in ventral cortical areas (2, 7) and even in V1 (8, 10, 12, 13) may have its origin in LIP as the gain controller.

In mice, we found the molecular association of a-Klotho (a-Kl) and Na+,K+adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+-ATPase) and provide evidence for an increase of abundance of Na+,K+-ATPase at the plasma membrane. Low concentrations of extracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]e) rapidly induce regulated parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in an a-Kl- and Na+,K+-ATPase­ dependent manner. The increased Na+ gradient created by Na+,K+-ATPase activity might drive the transepithelial transport of Ca2+ in cooperation with ion channels and transporters in the choroid plexus and the kidney. Our findings reveal fundamental roles of a-Kl in the regulation of calcium metabolism. lotho mutant mice are short-lived, and the gene responsible for the phenotype is called klotho (1). A homolog has also been identified and named b-klotho (2, 3). To avoid confusion, we refer to the original gene as a-klotho. The a-klotho (a-kl) gene encodes a type I membrane protein with considerable similarity to b-glycosidase that is predominantly expressed in tissues that are involved with calcium homeostasis; that is the parathyroid glands, kidney, and choroid plexus (4, 5) (supporting description 1). Although a-Kl has been predicted to be present on the cell surface, large amounts of a-Kl are detectable in the cytoplasm and the cleaved extracellular domain is secreted into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (6). In this paper, we show a

complex (Fig. 1B). These molecules also associated in mouse kidney and in human parathyroid glands (Fig. 1, C and D). In these tissues, the majority of a-Kl immunoreactivity was detectable in the cytoplasm, whereas a1-Na+,K+-ATPase immunoreactivity was observed at or near the cell surface and diffusely in the cytoplasm (fig. S2). We verified the above histological observations by the surface biotinylation and subcellular fractionation using the choroid plexus and the HeLa cells introduced with both a-Kl and a1-Na+,K+-ATPase fused with enhanced green fluorescence protein (a1Na+,K+-ATPase-EGFP), respectively. a-Kl was primarily detected in the nonbiotinylated cyto1 Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. 2Horizontal Medical Research Organization, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan. 3Integrative Brain Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. 4 Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan. 5Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. 6Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 6068501, Japan. 7Electron Microscopy Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. 8 Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Corporation, Saitama 3320012, Japan. 9Laboratory of Functional Networks for Chromosome Inheritance, Graduate School of Life Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0021, Japan. 10Section of Cell Signaling, Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Aichi 4448787, Japan. 11Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.

pivotal role of a-Kl in calcium homeostasis (mouse breeding conditions are described in supporting description 2 and fig. S1). We identified the a1 subunit of Na+,K+ATPase (a1-Na+,K+-ATPase) as an a-Kl binding protein (7) (supporting description 3) and further confirmed the binding by Western blot analysis and with reciprocal immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, A and B). a-Kl precipitated by monoclonal antibody to a1-Na+,K+-ATPase contained proteins that migrated as two bands of 120 and 135 kD, indicating that Na+,K+-ATPase binds to a-Kl regardless of its sugar moieties (Fig. 1B) (6). The b subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase, which has a major role in the regulation of membrane recruitment of Na+,K+-ATPase (8), was included in the a-Kl-Na+,K+-ATPase SCIENCE VOL 316
