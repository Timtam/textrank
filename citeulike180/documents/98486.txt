Mean near-bed velocity was compared between treatments using a non-parametric Mann±Whitney U-test because variances could not be transformed to satisfy parametric assumptions.

Resource consumption
After measuring near-bed ¯ow, 278 mg of SPM stained with Rose Bengal dye was released as a single pulse into each stream19. Larvae were allowed to feed for 15 min (a duration less than gut passage times) before they were removed from their nets and frozen. We dissected larval guts later and measured the diameter and band length of stained SPM in foreguts using a dissecting microscope and ocular micrometer. Because foreguts are essentially cylindrical, the consumption of SPM by each larva was calculated as mm3 SPM by p ´ band length in foregut ´ (1/2 foregut diameter)2. Per capita consumption was compared between treatments using t-tests. Total resource consumption (the summed consumption of SPM by all larvae inhabiting a stream) was compared between treatments using a non-parametric Mann±Whitney U-test because variances could not be transformed to satisfy parametric assumptions. We used a paired t-test to compare observed resource consumption in mixed assemblages with the total expected SPM consumption2.

Bed roughness
At the end of the experiment we recorded the downstream location of every caddis¯y net and measured their maximum heights and widths. We calculated the average maximum height and density of the roughness elements, as well as their aggregation and topographical complexity. Aggregation measures the spacing between roughness elements as the mean euclidian distance between neighbouring nets. Topographical complexity measures the spatial uniformity or non-uniformity of roughness elements as the standard deviation of the parabolic area (in mm2) of catchnets. An s.d. of 0 indicates a uniform streambed (no topographical complexity), whereas a higher s.d. indicates greater streambed complexity. We compared all four aspects of bed roughness between treatments using t-tests.

Humans integrate visual and haptic information in a statistically optimal fashion

When a person looks at an object while exploring it with their hand, vision and touch both provide information for estimating the properties of the object. Vision frequently dominates the integrated visual±haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position1±3, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics4±7. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the ®nal estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation8±15 to combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination quantitatively, we ®rst measured the variances associated with visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these measurements to construct a maximum-likelihood integrator. This model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual±haptic task. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated with visual estimation is lower than that associated with haptic estimation. The estimate of an environmental property by a sensory system can be represented by

If the noises are independent and gaussian with variance j 2, and the i bayesian prior is uniform, then the maximum-likelihood estimate

Thus, the MLE rule states that the optimal means of estimation (in the sense of producing the lowest-variance estimate) is to add the sensor estimates weighted by their normalized reciprocal variances8±15. If the MLE rule is used to combine visual and haptic Ã Ã estimates, SV and SH , the variance of the ®nal (visual±haptic) Ã estimate, S, is j2 j2 j2  2 V H 2 3 VH jV  jH Thus, the ®nal estimate has lower variance than either the visual or the haptic estimator. Implementation of MLE integration is shown for two hypothetical cases in Fig. 1. We examined visual±haptic integration quantitatively to determine whether human performance is optimal. Observers looked at and/or felt a raised ridge (Fig. 2) and judged its height (vertical extent). To work out the predictions of the MLE rule, we ®rst determined the variances of the visual and haptic height estimates (within-modality) by conducting discrimination experiments. In the haptic-alone experiment, observers indicated which of two sequentially presented ridges was taller from haptic information alone; in the visual-alone experiment, they did the same from visual information alone. There were four conditions in the visual experiment that differed in the amount of noise in the stimulus (see Methods). By adding noise we made the visually speci®ed height less reliable. Visual-alone and haptic-alone discrimination data are shown in Fig. 3a. The proportion of trials in which the observer indicated that the comparison stimulus (variable height) appeared taller than the standard stimulus (®xed height of 55 mm) is plotted as a function of

the height of the comparison stimulus. The dashed red line and symbols represent the haptic discrimination data, and the solid blue curves with open symbols represent the visual data for the four levels of noise. These psychometric functions were well ®t by cumulative gaussian functions. The discrimination threshold is de®ned as the difference between the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the height of the comparison stimulus when it is judged taller than the p standard stimulus 84% of the time. The 84% point corresponds to 2 times the standard deviation of the underlying estimator. The haptic discrimination threshold was roughly 0.085 times the average ridge height (which was 55 mm). As the noise increased from 0 to 200%, the visual discrimination thresholds increased from 0.04 to 0.2 times the average height. Thus, when the visual noise was 0%, the visual discrimination threshold was roughly half the haptic threshold; when the visual noise was 200%, the visual threshold was more than double the haptic threshold. In the visual±haptic experiment, observers simultaneously looked at and felt two raised ridges that were presented sequentially. In one presentation the visually and haptically speci®ed heights were equal (comparison stimulus); in the other presentation they differed (standard stimulus). The difference (D) in the speci®ed heights was 6 6, 6 3 or 0 mm (the average of SH and SV was 55 mm). For each D in the standard stimulus (randomly presented), the height of the comparison stimulus was varied randomly from trial to trial (47±63 mm). On each trial, the observer indicated which stimulus seemed taller. Figure 3b shows the proportion of trials in which the comparison stimulus was chosen as taller as a function of the height of the comparison stimulus. From these psychometric functions, we estimated the PSEÐthe comparison height appearing equal to the standard heightÐand the just-discriminable change in height (threshold). Using the within-modality data, we can predict what an observer using MLE will do when presented visual and haptic information

Dashed gaussians in the top panels represent probability densities of the (unbiased) estimated height from visual and haptic assessment, and solid gaussians represent probability densities for the combined estimate. On the left, the visual and haptic variances are equal (j2 =j2  1) and both their H V weights are 0.5 (equation (2)). The mean of the combined probability density is therefore equal to the mean of the visual and haptic densities and the variance is reduced by half (equation (3)). If the observer bases judgements of relative height on the combined

probability density, the psychometric function would be a cumulative gaussian (bottom left) with a point of subjective equality (PSE) equal to the average of the visual and haptic heights of the standard stimulus. On the right, the haptic variance is four times the visual variance: j2 =j2  4. By equation (2), the visual weight (wV) is 0.8 and the haptic weight H V (wH) is 0.2. Thus, the combined probability density is shifted towards the visual estimate and its variance is 0.8 times the visual variance (equation (3)). Accordingly, the psychometric function should be shifted so that the PSE is closer to the visual height of the standard stimulus.

The predicted visual weights are represented by the curve and shaded surround in Fig. 3c. The predicted weights vary signi®cantly with the amount of visual noise in the stimulus: the visual weights are higher when the noise level is low, and lower when the noise level is high. Assuming that the visual and haptic estimators are on Ã Ã average unbiased (SV  SV and SH  SH ), the weights can be derived experimentally: wV  PSE 2 SH =SV 2 SH  6 where PSE is the height of the comparison stimulus that matched the apparent height of the standard stimulus. The visually and haptically speci®ed heights in the standard stimulus, SV and SH, are indicated on the right ordinate. Figure 3c shows that as the noise level was increased the visual weight decreased, and the PSE shifted from SV towards SH. Because the noise level varied randomly from trial to trial, the weights must have been set within the 1-s stimulus presentation. Below, we suggest a mechanism for such dynamic weight adjustment. In summary, the predicted and observed PSEs are similar, suggesting that humans do combine visual and haptic information in a fashion similar to MLE integration. According to the MLE rule, the combined estimates should have lower variance, and therefore lower discrimination thresholds, than either the visual or haptic estimate alone (equation (3)). To derive predictions for the visual±haptic discrimination thresholds, we rewrite equation (3): T2 T2 1 1 1 T2  2 V H 2 , 2  2  2 7 VH T VH T V T H TV  TH The predicted and observed thresholds are shown in Fig. 3d. The open symbols represent the visual-alone thresholds and the dashed line represents the haptic-alone threshold. The shaded area represents the predicted visual±haptic thresholds; they are always lower than the visual-alone and haptic-alone thresholds at the corresponding noise level. The ®lled purple symbols represent the observed visual±haptic discrimination thresholds; as noise level increases, the just-noticeable difference in height becomes greater. Most notably, the predicted and observed visual±haptic discrimination thresholds are similar. As with the PSE data, this indicates that human observers may combine visual and haptic information in a manner similar to MLE integration. In summary, we found that height judgements were remarkably similar to those predicted by the MLE integrator. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion similar to the MLE rule: visual and haptic estimates are weighted according to their reciprocal variances (equation (2)). Naturally, it is important to determine whether this rule characterizes the estimation of other stimulus properties such as shape, depth, localization, roughness or compliance. The relative contributions of vision and haptics to perceiving such object properties have been studied previously. For example, subjects have grasped a square while looking at it through a distorting lens that made it appear rectangular1. The shape of the uni®ed percept was determined almost completely by vision, so the phenomenon was called `visual capture'. Numerous studies have

replicated visual capture in shape and size perception3,16,17, depth perception18 and localization2,19±21. But visual capture does not occur in the perception of surface roughness6,22; instead, perceived roughness is affected nearly equally by haptics and vision. Does a dynamic cue-combination rule, such as the one described here, determine the degree to which vision or haptics dominates? The statistically optimal means of combining visual and haptic informationÐthe MLE ruleÐpredicts that visual capture should occur whenever the visual estimate of a property has much less variance than that of the haptic estimate. Haptic capture should be observed when the reverse occurs. We observed behaviour like visual capture when the visual stimulus was noise-free, and behaviour similar to haptic capture when the visual stimulus was quite noisy (Fig. 3c). In visual±haptic tasks, the MLE integrator described here always uses information from both sensory systems, so the combined percept will always re¯ect both sources of information. Different behaviour may be observed when the discrepancy between two information sources is large. With large discrepancies between information sources, the nervous system may exhibit robust behaviour10 in which a discrepant source is discounted9,23. In robust estimation, the weights associated with different information sources are determined by more than the variances of the sensory estimators; they are also determined by the discrepancy between their estimates. In our experiments, the differences between the visually and haptically speci®ed stimuli were never greater than 11%, and the visual±haptic data always exhibited an in¯uence of both sensory systems. If the differences had been larger, we might

have observed discounting of one sense. It would be interesting to know whether such vetoing occurs when observers become aware of the con¯ict between visual and haptic inputs. If the nervous system implements MLE integration, the weights must be proportional to the reciprocal variances of the probability densities associated with the visual and haptic estimates of the environmental property in question (equation (2) and Fig. 1). Of course, the variances change from one object property to the next (such as size, shape or roughness) and from one situation to another (for example, visual variance increases as the lighting is degraded). Does the nervous system need to calculate or learn the variances associated with the visual and haptic estimators for each property and situation to implement MLE integration? Although explicit calculation or learning may occur24, there are plausible schemes in which explicit calculation of variances or weights is unnecessary. Consider, for example, a population of visual and haptic neurons, each sensitive to a range of heights. Each neuron has a preferred height but also responds to other heights (that is, each neuron has a tuning function). If the visual input speci®es the height clearly (that is, high contrast, noise-free, and so on), then the visual neurons preferring that height respond vigorously and those preferring other heights respond less, and the distribution of response across the population of visual neurons has a well de®ned peak. Assume that the distribution across the population of haptic neurons has a less well de®ned peak. Multiplication of these two distributions (pointby-point multiplication where the two populations are in registration according to the stimulus property being estimated)25 yields a

peak response closer to the visual than the haptic peak, as with MLE integration. If degrading the visual input causes the response distribution of the visual neurons to spread, then multiplication of the visual and haptic distributions yields a peak closer to the haptic peak, again as in MLE integration. Thus, the estimator variances (and therefore the weights) do not have to be calculated explicitly: the behaviour of an MLE integrator might be achieved through interactions among populations of visual and haptic neurons.

Methods
Stimuli
The stimulus was a horizontal bar raised 30 mm above a plane; the bar and plane were perpendicular to the line of sight (Fig. 2a). The width of the bar was 150 mm; its height varied but the average was S0 = 55 mm. Observers viewed the bar binocularly and/or grasped it with the index ®nger and thumb in order to estimate its height (Fig. 2a). Its vertical position was varied randomly from trial to trial. The haptic stimulus was generated using two PHANToM (SensAble Technologies) force-feedback devices (Fig. 2a), one each for the index ®nger and thumb. Finger and thumb movements had all six degrees of freedom in the 20-cm3 workspace. The threedimensional positions of the tips of the ®nger and thumb were monitored, and appropriate forces were applied when the tips reached the positions of the simulated haptic objects. PHANToMs compellingly simulate haptic properties such as the size, shape and stiffness of the bar. The apparatus was calibrated to align the visual and haptic stimuli spatially. The visual stimulus was a random-dot stereogram simulating the background plane and bar (Fig. 2). The dots subtended 8 arcmin at the 50-cm viewing distance. Dot density was roughly 9 dots per degree2. New dots were displayed with each presentation. The positions of the ®nger and thumb (tracked by the PHANToMs) were indicated by small threedimensional markers; the markers were visible until the bar was touched. Noise was added to the visual display to vary its reliability. The noise was a random displacement of the dot depths in the stereogram (direction parallel to line of sight). The displacements were drawn from a random uniform distribution whose range was 0, 67, 133 or 200% of the 3cm depth step between the bar and plane. The displacement of the dots is shown in Fig. 2. No noise was added to the haptic display. We wanted the presentation times for the visual and haptic stimuli to be identical. In the vision-alone discrimination experiment, the standard and comparison stimuli were displayed for 1 s each. In the haptic-alone discrimination experiment, the haptic stimulus began when the thumb and ®nger both contacted the bar and ended after 1 s. In the visual± haptic trials, the visually speci®ed bar did not appear until the bar was touched by both ®ngers simultaneously and the visual and haptic stimuli were extinguished after 1 s.

Procedure
Within-modality discrimination was measured in a two-interval, forced-choice scheme. Each trial consisted of the sequential (visual or haptic) presentation of two bars. In the standard interval, the bar was always 55 mm tall and in the comparison interval, it was shorter or taller than 55 mm. The standard and comparison stimuli were randomly assigned to the ®rst or second interval. The observer indicated the interval containing the apparently taller stimulus. The comparison height was varied according to the method of constant stimuli. We plotted psychometric functions, that is the proportion of trials in which the comparison was perceived as taller than the standard against the comparison height. From these functions, we could determine PSEs and discrimination thresholds. Half of the vision-alone and haptic-alone discrimination experiments were conducted (in random order) before the visual±haptic experiment and the other half were conducted after. In the visual±haptic experiment, observers were again presented two stimuli sequentially: the standard stimulus (visually and haptically speci®ed heights differed by D) and the comparison stimulus (visually and haptically speci®ed heights were the same). The average height of the standard stimulus was always 55 mm and the visual±haptic difference (D) ranged from -6 to +6 mm. The height of the comparison varied. The observer indicated the interval containing the apparently taller stimulus. Trials with different con¯icts were presented in random order to prevent visuomotor adaptation. No feedback was given in any of the experiments. Four observers (aged 22 to 33), naive to the experimental purpose, participated. They were right handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The observers were questioned at the end: none of them had noticed the con¯icts between the visually and haptically speci®ed heights.

Perception of a visual target and the responses of cortical neurons can be strongly in¯uenced by a context surrounding the target1±27. This observation relates to the fundamental issue of how cortical neurons code objects of the external world. In high-contrast regimes, embedding a target in an iso-oriented context reduces neural responses and deteriorates performance in psychophysical experiments. Performance from orthogonal surrounds is better than that from iso-oriented ones1±17. This contextual interference is often postulated to be caused by long- or short-range interac433
