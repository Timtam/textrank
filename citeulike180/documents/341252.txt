Abstract
We present a Bayesian statistical analysis of the conformations of side chainsin proteins from the Protein Data Bank. This is an extension of the backbone-dependent rotamer library, and includes rotamer populations and average y angles for , a full range of 4,+ values. The Bayesian analysis used here provides a rigorous statistical method for taking account of varying amounts of data. Bayesian statistics requires the assumption of aprior distribution for parameters over their range of possible values. This prior distribution can be derived from previous data or from pooling some of the present data. The prior distribution is combined with the data to form the posterior distribution, which is a compromise between the prior distribution and the data. For the ,y2. , y 3 , and ,y4 rotamer prior distributions, we assume that the probability of each rotamer type is dependent only on the previous y rotamer in the chain. For the backbone-dependence of the , y I rotamers, , we derive prior distributions from the product of the +dependent and +-dependent probabilities. Molecular mechanics calculations with the CHARMM22 potential show a strong similarity with the experimental distributions, indicating that proteins attain their lowest energy rotamers with respect to local backbone,side-chain interactions. The new library is suitable for use in homology modeling, protein folding simulations, and the refinement of X-ray and NMR structures.

Keywords: Bayesian statistics; molecular mechanics; protein structure; rotamers; side chains

In the last I O years, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has more than tripled in size. As the PDB has grown, it has become possible to analyze protein structure in greater detail and with greater statistical certainty. Although some studies have been qualitative in nature, the size of the database now enables us to put some structural variables on a more sound statistical footing. One aspect of protein structure that has been analyzed over a period of many years is the distribution of protein side-chain conformations. Sidechain rotamer libraries (Chandrasekaran & Ramachandran, 1970; Cody et al., 1973; James & Sielecki, 1983; Ponder & Richards, 1987) consist of a list of discrete side-chain conformations and their associated probabilities determined from their frequency of occurrence in the PDB. In most cases, these conformations correspond to "rotamers" or local minima on potential energy maps (Bhat et al., 1979; Gelin & Karplus, 1979; Benedetti et al., 1983) with frequencies predictable from conformational analysis of organic molecules (Janin et al., 1978; Dunbrack & Karplus, 1994). The discreteness of rotamers is enforced by barriers of 4-10 kcal/ mol due to the overlap of bond molecular orbitals in eclipsed conformations (Karplus & Parr, 1963).

As more high-resolution structures have become available in recent years, it has become possible to determine rotamer preferences asa function of backbone conformation. Earlier efforts found weak correlations of rotamer distributions in different secondary structures (Janin et al., 1978; McGregor et al., 1987; Sutcliffe et al., 1987; Schrauber et al., 1993). With an extended database of 132 protein chains with resolution better than or equal to 2.0 8, we compiled a backbone-dependent rotamer library (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1993) that gives the side-chain , y I rotamer distribution for each amino acid type and each occupied 10" by 10" region of the conformation space of the backbone. , y l rotamer preferences show detectable patterns as a function of 4 and $ for all side chains that can be explained by simple steric conformational analysis (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1994). The backbone-dependent rotamer library has been shown to be useful as a tool for predicting side-chain conformations from backbone coordinates for homology modeling (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1993; Bower et al., 1997) and for NMR and X-ray structure refinement (Kuszewski et al., 1996). The results obtained are a significant improvement over backbone-independent rotamer libraries. Although the larger database presently available affords a more complete view of the variation of rotamer preferences as a function of 4 and much of the Ramachandran map is sparsely populated because of backbone-backbone steric exclusions. Even in wellpopulated regions of the Ramachandran map, some rotamers are quite rare and their frequencies are therefore statistically unreli-

able. For the purposes of homology modeling, protein folding simulations, experimental structure refinement, and comparison with energy calculations, we need more complete estimates of rotamer distributions than are available in the database. In this paper, we use Bayesian statistical analysis to account for the varying amount of informationinthedatabase for , I backboney dependent rotamer distributions. In addition, certain combinations of the x I , , y 2 , ,y3, and ,y4 rotamers are rare and the Bayesian analysis provides a better estimate of their probability of occurrence than do the data alone. Such "sparse data corrections" have been used in the calculations of potentials of mean force from PDB data by Sippl(l990) and by Sali and Blundell(1993), although not labeled Bayesian statistics as such. Briefly, Bayesian statistical analysis provides a framework for combining "prior" information about measurable quantities with (usually limited) experimental data to determine a better estimate of a parameter of interest than the data alone provide. A simple example is in the flipping of a coin that may be slightly biased. As prior information, perhaps after a visual inspection, we might posis fairly close to 1/2. We tulate that the probability of heads (e,,,) guess a probability distribution for Ohrod, that extends between 0 and 1 , but is peaked around ehpod,, = 0.5. Ifwe flip the coin 10 times and get 7 heads, we would not be justified in saying that ehuod., is 0.7. We need to consider the likelihood of getting 7 heads from I O tosses, given all possible values for the underlying parameter Ohradr. The likelihood function is denoted p ( ~ l 0 )because , it is the probability of the data y given the parameter 0. In Figure 1, we show a prior distribution and likelihood function for the coin flipping example. It is clear that the likelihood of getting 7 heads from 10 tosses is significant even when eh&, = 0.5. The goal of Bayesian analysis is a full view of the distribution of Ohpad,, given the data, in the coin flipping example, p(Oht,ad,y~2c,,~/,,,n). central equation of Bayesian statistics, deI The

As shown in Figure 1, in the coin flipping example, the posterior distribution for 6hrad.y peaks just above 0.5 because of the observed data of 7 heads from 10 tosses. The extent of the shift from the data value (0.7) isincorporated into the analysis by the form of the prior distribution. In any case, as the number of observations, n, increases, the resulting distribution, p(Bhead,rl yhead,y,n) becomes more concentrated at the observed ratio of heads to tosses. It is central to Bayesian analysis that the posterior distribution is more than a point estimate for a parameter such as e k e o & instead, it is a probability distribution over the full range of allowed values of the parameter. This aspect can be exploited by simulation, where values for the parameter can be drawn randomly from the posterior distribution and used to explore the distribution of any function of the parameter. This method is used here to show how well the calculated posterior distributions for rotamer probabilities correspond to the raw data in the PDB. With a full analysis of the rotamer preferences of protein side chains from Bayesian statistics, we compare the experimental data with molecular mechanics calculations using the C H A R " potential. Previous calculations (Ponnuswamy & Sasisekharan, 1971; Sasisekharan & Ponnuswamy, 1971; Pullman & Pullman, 1974; Janin et al., 1978; Marcus et al., 1996) emphasized the limitations that individual side chains place on the backbone conformation. In contrast, we show the potential energy surfaces in a way that captures the limitations the backbone places on the side-chain conformation, and we compare the results with conformational analysis based on data on hydrocarbons such as butane and pentane, as described previously (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1994), and with the experimental distributions derived from the Bayesian analysis. A number of protein-folding models suggests that backbone conformations are achieved earlier in folding than final side-chain conformations (Shakhnovich & Finkelstein, 1989; Bromberg & Dill, 1994; Dill et al., 1995). If this is the case, then the restrictions that the backbone places on side-chain conformations are of great importance in understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. In a subsequent paper, we will examine the correspondence between energy calculations and the experimental data in a more quantitative fashion with a statistical mechanical model that examines the influence of both local backbone conformation and tertiary packing interactions on protein side chains.

value of 1.O means that the prior "sample size" is equal to the data sample size, and the two parts then make equal contributions to the posterior distribution. We find a value of K = 0.5 to be reasonable, as described in the Materials and methods. In Table 2, the backbone-independent prior distribution parameters derived from the raw data are listed for several side-chain types. These include values for p(rblr,), where {a,b} = { 1,2), , {2,3), or {3,4), as well as the y angle averages and their standard The values for these parameters for the remaining deviations, (T. side chains are available on our website (Dunbrack, 1997). The parameters from the posterior distribution for Met are listed in rl Table 3. Met has 27 r2,r31 rotamers, and 10 of these have been seen less than 10 times each in our set of 5 18 protein chains from the PDB. The posterior distribution provides a better estimate for the frequency of these rare rotamers than the data alone, because it contains very good estimates in the prior distribution. This isalso the case for Arg and Lys, with 81 backbone-independent rotamers each, many of which have never been seen in protein structures because of their significant steric strain. It is the case that for all side chains except Asn and Asp, there is little or no dependence and +. The backbone-independent liof Ojli or X 2 ( j l i ) on and brary therefore consists of values for the parameters { X 2 ,X3.X4}( j,k,ll i). full backbone-independent library is also The available on our website (Dunbrack, 1997). Bayesian analysis o backbone-dependent f rotamer populations Determination of the backbone-dependent rotamer library is more difficult than the backbone-independent library because of the large number of parameters to be estimated. We would like to define the probabilities of the three rl rotamers (two for Pro) for all values of and on a grid with 10" spacing. The infinite data parameters will be denoted Orlab for the proportion of side chains with rl = i in a region near { 4 = IJ = + b ) . Because of the constraint that .CiOilab = 1, the total number of parameters is 2 X 36 X 36 or 2,592 for each side-chain type. Because the data are very concenregions (a-helix and P-sheet regions), we trated in particular need some procedure for estimating the probabilities across the Ramachandran map. The full procedure is described in Materials and methods, but the results of each stage will be illustrated here. The first step is to count the side chains of each rotamer type using weighting functions shown in Figure 2 (illustrated for +a = -60", +b = -60"). The weighting function in Figure 2A, defined in Equation 7 in Materials and methods, has a Gaussian shaped peak at It also has much smaller peaks at [+a ? 180°, +b) and {+,, +b 2 180") and a very small peak at [ 4, ? 180", +b 2 180"). Because the backbone-conformation dependent steric interand actions that affect rotamer preferences are periodic in every 180" (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1994) (described in detail below), the secondary peaks in theweighting function serve to supplement very sparse regions with data from regions of the and/or +. In most cases, Ramachandran map 180" away in heavily populated regions in the primary peak correspond to sparsely populated regions in the secondary peaks and vice versa. In Figure 2B, we show the function used in our previous work (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1993), denoted W;'I(+,+). which gives weights point of 1.0 to side chains with and within 10" of the and 0.0 to allothers. In Figure 2C, the product of the functions in Figure 2A and B is shown. This function,denoted W:r-Pe'(+,+), counts only side chainswithin 10" of but with

distributions of p(rzrr3,r41rl). is in contrast to traditional This backbone-independent rotamer libraries which consist of values (e.g., for p ( r l r r z r r 3 , r 4 ) Ponder & Richards, 1987). For methionine, for instance, we would like to estimate values for the conditional probabilities of rz = j , r3 = k given that rl = i or p(r2 = j , r 3 = klr, = i ) that would be measured from an infinitely large data set. We denote the infinite data set parameters for these quantities as Olkl,. We derive prior distributions from a supposition that p ( r z = j ; r 3 = k l r , = i ) a p ( r 3 klr2 = j ) p ( r z = j l r , = j). (2) = That is, rotamer probabilities along the chain of the side chain are dependent only on the previous dihedral. We use the probabilities in Equation 2 as the modes (maximum values) of prior distributions for each of the nine Ojkli for each rI rotamer i. The factors on the right-hand side of Equation 2 come directly from the raw data population probabilities for each side-chain type. Equation 2 is quite a good approximation with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 for the raw data probabilities versus the prior distribution estimate for Arg, Met, Gln, Glu, and Lys. The form of both the prior and posterior distributions is a Dirichlet function, a generalization of the multinomial distribution. In forming the posterior distribution from the prior distribution and the data, we need to choose how heavily to weight the prior distribution in relation to the data. An equivalent statement is that we need to define the variance of the prior distribution compared to the variance of the data. To accomplish this, we scale the prior distribution to correspond to some proportion of the data sample size with a scale parameter K . A

a weight similar to that in Figure 2A. It will be used to count data for the likelihood function (see below). To check that the periodic and nonperiodic functions do not alter the probabilities significantly from our previous "box" function, we calculated the correlation coefficients for values of [4,+) with more than 20 side chains counted with Wbox.For Wper, the correlation coefficient with W br'x was 0.987, and for W "On-per, the correlation coefficient with Wb" was 0.999. Between W p e r and Wnon-per correlation the coefficient was 0.985. The next step is to use the weighted counts of Wperto derive a prior density distribution for use in a Bayesian analysis for the backbone-dependent rotamer library. We choose a prior density distribution centered on a product of +dependent densities and +-dependent densities, i.e.,

The factors on the right-hand side of Equation 3 can be calculated by taking the logs of each side of Equation 3 and solving the resulting linear equations by singular value decomposition. The approximation in Equation 3 is not quite as good as thebackboneindependent case, but good enough to provide reasonable estimates of the probabilities throughout the Ramachandran map. For Arg,

for instance, the correlation coefficient for { 4,+) values in occupied regions of the Ramachandran map (>20 side chains) between the prior distribution values calculated from the right-hand side of Equation 3 and the raw data values calculated with function w n o n - p e r IS 0.952. As with the backbone-independent prior distributions (Equation 2), values of p(r1 = i l & , + b ) , denoted defined in Equation 3 indicate the central values (modes) of Dirichlet probability distributions or p ( @ j l a b ) . In Figure 3, we show the prior distribution modes calculated with the weighting function Wperfor several side-chain types plotted on top of bar charts of the data measured with the nonperiodic weighting function Wnon-per for values of 4 and +h with y, > 20 or Y b > 20. The procedure used , to derive the curves in Figure 3 attempts to decouple the 4 and dependence, and so, for instance, the +-dependence of the r , = 3 rotamer prior density is much flatter than the data density (the bars in Figure 3). In this case, the prior density does not respond to the strong variations of the probabilities of the other two rotamers with In Figure 4, we show the prior distribution, the data density calculated with the weighting function Wper and with W n o n - p e r , and the posterior distribution for the three rl rotamers of Arg. Comparing the data in Wno'"per with the other plots demonstrates

the utility of the Bayesian method for combining an informative prior distribution with the W n o n - p e r data to produce the posterior distribution. The W non-per data cover a small percentage of the total #,+ plot with isolated regions with existent data and large regions with no data. The prior distribution is a smoothed and partially symmetrized reconstruction of the data. Adding back the nonperiodic data to the prior distribution to produce the posterior distribution ensures that, in populated regions, the posterior distribution represents the data quite closely. In less populated regions, however, the prior distribution is more important and more likely to be accurate than the nonperiodic data alone. In unpopulated regions, the raw data areof no use, and we must rely on the accuracy of the prior distribution defined in Equation 3. In Figure 5, we show the results for three more side-chain types (Asp, Phe,and Val) to demonstrate the similarities and differences between various types of residues. Side-chain pairs with similar stereochemistries behave similarly, especially with similar chemistry at both the p and y positions (e.g., Asp-Asn, LysArg, Phe-Tyr). Thedifferences between theP-unbranched and &branched side-chain distributions are clearly due to Cylbackbone interactions. Branching at y and electrostatic interactions also affect the distributions in less drastic ways (e.g., Asp-Arg, Lys-Phe). As noted earlier, the backbone-dependent library does not include a dependence of r2 rotamers on thebackbone dihedrals # and

$, except in the case of Asp and Asn. Asp and Asn x2 distributions are not described easily as rotamers, because the distributions are nearly continuous with only one mode. But there is a significant skew to the distributions due to backbone-conformation-independent Nj and Cj andbackbonesyn-pentaneeffectswithbackbone conformation-dependent electrostatic effects with backbone atoms 1. To represent the skewness of the of residues i - 1, i , and i distributions, we define rotamers for x2 for Asp andAsn in Table 1 centered at +60°, O", and -60". With these definitions, we can plot the r2 probabilities varying with q5 and +. There isa weak dependence of p(r21rl ) on # and for Lys, Met, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ile, and Leu (data not shown). For example, the values of p(r21r I )for r2 = 2(t)range from 60% to 80% with # and 9 in an identical manner in all of these side chains, with similar variations in the r2 = 1 and r2 = 3 rotamers. But for weakly there are not enough data to deterpopulated values of q5 and mine these values, even with the periodic weighting function used to determine the backbone-dependence of the rl rotamers. The situation for Asp and Asn is quite different. There are large probabilities with changes inbackbone dihedrals, shifts inp(r21rl) in some cases shifts of density of 80% or more. The backbonedependent rotamer library for Asp and Asn therefore contains valr21#,+), whereas for the other side chains, the backboneues forp(rl, dependent part of the library contains only the parameters for P('I 144).

Conformational analysis of backbone-independent interactions
As a very simple model for steric interactions in biopolymers, we have previously compared the distribution of side-chain rotarners with steric interactions that are well-documented in simple hydrocarbons such as butane and pentane (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1994). The barrier to rotation in ethane was estimated to be 3.0 kcal/mol as early as the 1930's (Kemp & Pitzer, 1937) with potential energy maxima in the "eclipsed conformations (i.e., with a dihedral H-CC-H = 0") and minima with the hydrogens "staggered" with each H-C-C-H dihedral equal to +60", 180". or -60". From spectroscopic data and the experimental thermodynamics of longer hydrocarbons, it was also clear that certain combinations of neighboring dihedrals, namely g+,g- and g-,g+, in longer hydrocarbons were not allowed because of steric hindrance between carbon atom i and i 4 of the chain (Pitzer, 1940a, 1940b). Recent high-level ab initiocalculations (Wiberg & Murcko, 1988) and experimental measurements (Dung & Cornpton. 1979; Compton et al., 1980) have shown that the single gauche interaction in butane is about 0.9 kcal/mol higher than the global minimum trans conformation (1 80"). The abinitio energy of two consecutive gauche interactions of like sign in pentane has an energy of 1.4 kcal/mol above the syn-pentane global minimum ( t , t } conformation,whereasthe (g',g- } conformation had an energy of 3.3 kcal/mol above ( t , t ) (Wiberg & Murcko, 1988). Side-chain y and 6 heavy atoms (of the ith residue) can interact with backbone atoms Ni and Ci in ways that are dependent on the values of xI and x2, These interactions have been recognized for some timeas being responsible for the ( rl ,rZ)rotamer distribution of protein side chains (Chandrasekaran & Ramachandran, 1970). In Figure 7A, we show a Newman projection of ( rl ,rz } rotamers for hydrocarbon side chains (Lys, Arg, Met, Glu, Gln, Leu, Val, Ile). In Table 4, the backbone-independent gauche and syn-pentane interactions for all side-chain types are listed. We can count these interactions to get a rough estimate of steric and dihedral strain in the various rotamer combinations. Each gauche interaction, g, costs about 0.9 kcal/mol, whereas each syn-pentane interaction costs 2g + p . where p = 1.5 kcal/mol. We also include the CHAR" energies in Table 4 for the 2-amino pentanoic acid ("Ape"; side chain = (Ccr)-CHz-CH2-CH3), ne, and Leu side chains. These energies are given relative to the lowest energy for each rl rotamer, and therefore represent the interactions responsible for the parameters of the conditional backbone-independent rotamer library described above. The rl and r2 rotamers of Lys, Arg, Met, Glu, Gln, Leu,and ne are exactly analogous to the g+, t, and g- rotamers of butane and pentane, because, for these side chains, the xI and x2 dihedral rotations are about sp3-sp3 carbon-carbon bonds (xl = Ccu-Cp and x2 = Cp-Cy). For the aromatic side chains and Asn and Asp, the y heavy atom has an sp2 hybridization state, and therefore the x2 rotation is not described by the g + , t, g- rotameric states. The energy curves of the peptide fragment of 2-amino pentanoic as acid are given in Figure 8A a function of x2 for each of the three rl rotamers. Four of the nine local minima have syn-pentane in-

With an infinitely large database, we would simply calculate the distribution of x angles, ( j I , 2 2 , # 3 , j 4 } , as a funcThere are not enough data in the datation of (+,t,b,rlrr2.r3,r4). base for rare and even not-so-rare rotamers to determine this many parameters, and so we make use of informative prior distributions and calculate only a subset of the possible x angle parameters. The prior distributions are based on the approximation that x angle averages are likely to depend only on their own rotameric state and the rotameric states (or and # dihedrals in the case of r l ) one previous in the chain and after in the chain. As an example, we one show the one-dimensional prior distributions for xI averages as a function of # in Figure 6 for all several side-chain types. The forms of these functions are explained easily with the conformational analysis reviewed in the next section. We combine the prior distributions for the xI angles as shown in Figure 6 with the data to

These occur for all three r l = g+ rotamers, and so Leu is very unlikely to be ina g + rotamer. The conditional probabilities for the rl = g rotamer of Leu in Table 2 shows that the ( g + , g - } rotamer has much lower probability than the other two g',gc and g + , t . The reason is evident from Table 4, because the (g+,g- ) combination has two syn-pentane interactions with the backbone, whereas the other two r l = g A rotamers have only one.

In Figure 8B, the energies of Phe rotamers demonstrate that the rl rotamer affects the position of the local xZminimum. Assuming the sp3-sp' rotation about Ca-CP has minima at +90" and -90", there is some deviation in the t and g- rl rotamers. These are caused by interactions of the C6 atoms with backbone N;and C;: when rl is g-, a syn-pentane interaction when is below 90" pushes the minimum to ,yz = +100"; when rl is r, a syn-pentane is above 90" pushes the minimum down to interaction when x2 = +78". g + rotamers are always higher than g- and t rotamers

Conformational analvsis of backbone-conformation-dependent interactions
Rotamer populations are affected not only by backbone N, and C, of residue i whose positions arc independent of 4 and 4, but also by the positions of other backbone atoms, especially C,- ,, O;, and N,,,, whose positions are dependent on 4 and 4. These three

atoms are all connected to y heavy atoms by two sp3 hybridized atoms (CP and C a ) and one sp' hybridized atom (backbone N, or C,). There are therefore two dihedral degrees of freedom separating the y heavy atoms with the backbone atoms C,- ,, H,, Oi, and N,+ I (see Fig. 7B for the Newman projection of the side-chain with the dipeptide backbone added). We include H, and its hydrogen bond acceptor, because there are apparent shifts in rotamer populations due to this interaction. Hence, there is the possibility of syn-pentane interactions between any of these atoms and sidechain y atoms when the connecting dihedrals occur in ( g ' , g - ) or [ g - , g A) combinations. The interactions are of smaller magnitude, because bond angles at the sp' hybridized atoms are 120" instead of 109.5'. They are nevertheless of sufficient magnitude to alter the rotamer distributions significantly. Thesyn-pentane interactions that occur between y heavy atoms and backbone atoms dependent on 4 and I are listed in Table 5, along with the probable ) ranges of interaction. As with pentane, the range of interaction is about 90". We calculated the energies of the rotamers of several sidc chains to investigate how well the CHARMM potential describes the experimental distributions of the backbone-dependent rotamer library. This was done by minimizing the energy of the dipeptide of each residue type (N-acetyl-Xxx-N'methylamide) with 4 and 4 constrained to values in IO" increments.

When rl = g+. we expect a syn-pentane interaction when 4 = 60" (Cy and Ci- I ) and - 120" (Cy and O---HNi)and when +b = -60" (Cy and Ni+I ) and 120"(Cy and 0).These areshown clearly as the vertical and horizontal darker regions in the first panel of Figure 9A forthe Abu side-chain. These are also evident as troughs in the experimental data in the rl = I panels of Figure 3 (marked by arrows). These interactions also appear as the dark regions in interthe rl = 1 panels of Figure 4 and Figure 5. The C Y / C ; - ~ action is the largest, approximately 3.2 kcal/mol, whereas the C y / Ni+I and C y / O jinteractions are 1.6 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. In the second panel of Figure 9A. the interactions o f t rotamer Cy

with Ni+ I when +b = ? 180" and Cy with Oi when +b = 0" are also evident. These probability minima are also evident experimentally in the rl = 2 panels of Figures 3,4, and 5. Again, these interactions are marked by arrows in Figure 3. The third panel of Figure 9A confirms the C y / C i - I interaction when c$ = 5 180" and near 0" for the g- rl rotamer, as shown in the data in Figures 3.4, and 5. It is worth noting the weak +b dependence in the g- panels, reflecting changes in the energies of the other two rotamers as a function of +b.It is clear from the three maps that the x, = - 60"conformation of Abu is the most favored in much of the heavily occupied portions of the Ramachandran map (Le., - 120" 5 c$ 5 -40"; -80" 5 +b 5 -30" and 1 0 0 " 5 +b 5 150"). rl = t has steric interactions with backbone atoms in extended backbone conformations and

(AGfi,/,/i,,,v 5-20 kcal/mol). It would seem that a protein would = not be able to afford more than one or two such side-chain conformations, and it would therefore be useful to scrutinize the electron density carefully in such cases to determine if there are interactions that explain the high-energy conformation or whether a more plausible conformation can be found (Schrauber et al., 1993). These results can be considered minimum values for any sidechain prediction method for the self-backbone prediction test, because they were obtained with no computational effort beyond looking up the best rotamer in the database. We have recently used the backbone-dependent rotamer library described in this paper in a prediction program that removes steric clashes after the backbonedependent rotamer library prediction (Bower et al., 1997). Removing steric clashes in a set of 299 self-backbone side-chain prediction tests raises the prediction rate from 73% to 78%. We compared X-ray structures of identical proteins in different crystal space groups and found that only 80% of side chains retain their rl rotamers in different crystal structures. It is likely that a large fraction of the remaining 20% are in two different rl rotamers, one of which is the lowest energy rotamer for the local backbone conformation.

Discussion
Understanding the factors that determine protein side-chain conformation and its dynamics is important in a number of areas. First, the fact that the backbone has such a strong effect on side-chain conformation distributions is likely to be exploited by proteins as they fold. This effect may also operate as proteins evolve if mutations of residues with unfavorable steric interactions to residues without these interactions increase the stability of the folded protein. This topic has been studied extensively using site-directed mutagenesis to probe the structural and thermodynamic implications of a side chain's interaction with its environment. Mutations that increase or decrease local backbone-side-chain steric interactions might be expected to have some effect on the stability of the folded structure, because these interactions are presumably absent in the unfolded state. Second, homology modeling of proteins for the purposes of drug design depends mostly upon an accurate representation of the sidechain conformations in the target structure. It has proved very difficult to model the insertion and deletion of loops in proteins, but, in cases where these insertions are far from the binding site of an enzyme substrate or allosteric effector, it is only the binding site side-chain conformations that must be constructed carefully. Because proteins favor their dipeptide low-energy rotamers in their folded states, the backbone-dependent rotamer library is especially helpful in predicting side-chain conformations in homology modeling situations where no information is present in the template structure (e.g., Ala + Val; Pro + Phe). It is notable thatmany current side-chain placement methods use rotamer libraries dependent on the local structural environment of side chains (Moult & James, 1986; Levitt. 1992; Bower et al., 1997), including those popular molecular modeling packages, e.g., used in several QUANTA (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1993). SYBYL (Schrauber et al.. 1993), and WHAT-IF (Chinea et al., 1995). We have set up a website of the conformational analysis of protein side chains (Dunbrack, 1997) as described in this paper. The website includes both backbone-independent and backbone-

near +b = O", whereas rl = 60" has steric conflicts in P-sheets as well as a-helices. In Figure 9B, the CHARMM probability and energy surfaces for Val are shown. The alternation between t and 8 - rotamers with variation in +b isdue to interactions with each y carbon with backbone N,+I and 0,. which result in the troughs at +b = 0" and 180" for the second panel ( t )and at +b = -60" and 120" in the third panel ( g - ) . Both of these rotamers have steric interactions with Ci- I at #J = - 180". and so the g+ rotamer in the first panel has high density in this region. These figures can be compared with the experimental probabilities from the Bayesian analysis for Valin Figure 3G and H, and Figure 5. Finally, inTable 6, we show the prediction rates for the backbonedependent rotamer library. The data in this table were obtained by predicting the side-chain conformation for each side chain in the database based on the identity of the rI rotamer with the largest probability in the posterior distribution, given the values of #J and +b for that side chain. No optimization or removal of steric clashes was performed. The library is able to predict 73% of xi's of side chains that have structures within 40" of one of the canonical sp3-sp3 rotamers (+60", 180". -60"). From the steric analysis and the CHARMM calculations, it seems that most of these are sterically the lowest energy minima (Le., ignoring electrostatic interactions in polar sidechains) given the local backbone dihedral angles #J and Another 22% of side chains adopt the next most likely local minimum energy structure, and the final 5% the highest energy, least likely local minimum. Close to 4% of all side chains are not within 40" of one of the g + , g - , and t rotamer conformations. It is likely that most of these are either an average of two occupied rotamers, or an error of interpretation of electron density, given the high energy price paid (3-6 kcal/mol) for these strained conformations and that proteins are only marginally stable

On the website we make available the graphical representations for all side-chain types. As the PDB continues to grow, we will update the results presented here periodically and place them on the website.

Although many of the steric effects in backbone-independent and dependent side-chain conformations described in this paper have been studied previously in protein structures (Chandrasekaran & Ramachandran, 1970; Cody et al., 1973; Janin et al., 1978; Bhat et al., 1979; Benedetti et al., 1983; James & Sielecki, 1983; 1987; Sutcliffe McGregor et al., 1987; Ponder & Richards, et a1.,1987; Tuffery et al., 1991) and by energy calculations (Pon-

In particular, the conformational analysis of gauche and syn-pentane interactions has provided a simple organizing principle for explaining and predicting the effects of backbone conformation on side-chain conformation that previously has not been used extensively on peptides. We hope the library will be useful in a number of applications as well as furthering our understanding of the determinants of protein conformation and the process of protein folding.

Materials and methods
Experimental data To update the backbone-dependent rotamer library, we obtained a list of protein chains with 2.0 8, resolution or better and less than 50% sequence identity with other chains in the list from the OBSTRUCT server of Heringa et al. (1992). The present library is based on 518 chains, which is four times larger than the original library. The list of proteins used is available on the BackboneDependent Rotamer Library Website (Dunbrack, 1997). and Rotamers r l , r 2 , r g , r4 were defined according to the limits , on y angles listed in Table 1 for each amino acid type. Residues with missing backbone atoms necessary to determine #J and @ (i.e., the first and last residue of a chain) or with missing side-chain atoms were discarded. As in the previous work, we assumed that, in crystal structures, the ,y2 orientations of the His and Asn side chains and the x3 orientation of Gln are not uniquely determined under a rotation of 180". For the raw backbone-independent library, we used the limits in Table 1 to count the number of side chains with rl,r2,r3,r4 = i,j,k,l for all side-chain types. These numbers, Y i j k l , can be used to calculate various raw conditional probabilities, which will be used in the Bayesian analysis. To be consistent with our previous work (Dunbrack & Karplus, 1993, 1994), we first calculated a "raw" count of each rl in 20" by 20" #J,@ centered 10" apart (- 180", - 170", ..., 0", ..., 160", bins 170") in #J and @. Each sidechain is counted four times in such a procedure. Mathematically, we can define a function Wboxfor a bin centered at ( # J o , @ b ) that is applied to all side chains with rotamer rl = i , such that

I , where Adm = #Jm - #Ja and AGm = $ - @b. Wbox= 1 if both A#Jmand A@mare less than 10"; W box = 0 otherwise. The function w box isshowninFigure 2 for { # J a , @ b ) = { -60", -60'1. The = jry:Tzb. corresponding probabilities are denoted

To provide estimates for the underpopulated and unpopulated regions of the map, we used a Gaussian weighted periodic function to count rotamers. Side chains were counted for each rl rotamer bins type with the following weight function in #J,@ centered 10" apart (-180", -170", ..., 0". ..., 170"):

Bayesian statistical analysis Rotamer statistics We derive a library used for predictions of side-chain rotmers from the PDB by a Bayesian statistics analysis (Gelman et d., 1995). In this section, we describe Bayesian statistical analysis briefly; further details for the rotarner library are described below. We follow the notation of Gelman et al. (1995). We are considering

a population of side chains in different states or rotamers. We refer to the probabilities of the different rotamers as 0,. so for the three rl rotamers we have 0 , . 0.. and These are superpopulation parameters; that is, the probabilities of the three different rotamers in a hypothetical infinitely large Protein Data Bank. The observed data, yI. y2, and y3. are the numbers of rotamers observed in the finite experimental data of the PDB. Unless the total of yI + y2 + v 3 = N is large (>50), the observed populations y J N may differ somewhat from the 0,. Bayesian analysis provides a method for calculating a probability distribution of thc parameters 0 based on the ohserved data y, where 0 and y are vectors with m components ( m = 3 in this example). We start with the joint probnbilir?.distribution for 0 and y written with Bayes' rule as the product of a prior distribution p ( 0 ) and the likelihood or santplin,? distribution p(V 0).
p(0.v) = P(o)P(vlo).

Because y is fixed, we can write the posterior distribution p(8lv) as proportional to the unnormalized posterior densie.

(8)

So if we have some guess for the prior distribution p ( 0 ) and a model for the likelihood function p(vl0) for the probability of the data given values for the parameters, wecan derive a posterior probability distribution for the parameters, p(Ol>v). There is a distinction in Bayesian statistics between hformative and noninfonnative prior distributions. Noninformative prior distributions are usually flat functions of the parameters 0. Informativc prior distributions are defined by probabilities that are higher in certain ranges of the parameters 0 where we expect the value of 0 to lie, and probabilities that are lower in less likely ranges. For the rotamer problem, we use a multinomial model, such that thc likelihood takes the form

The prior distribution contains any information we may have about the expected value of 0 in the form of a probability density over the acceptable values of 0. We are looking for an expression forp(BI>I), which is the probability distribution of the parameters of interest, B, conditioned on the observed experimental data. y. Using Bayes' rule again. such that, p(0.y) = p(v)p(eIy), we find,

I y,, the sum of the counts of the different rotamers, where v,, = and C,B, = 1. We use a conjugate prior distribution [a prior distribution that has a similar mathematical form to the sampling distribution (Equation 1 I)] called the Dirichlet distribution,

Bayesian simulation of the posterior distribution Bayesian inference is frequently performed by means of simulation, especially when prior distributions and sampling distributions are complicated and do not produce an analytical posterior distribution. We use such a technique as a means for finding the best prior distribution. To check our models against the experimental data, it is useful to make predictions of the data from the posterior distribution of the parameters. We refer to these as yreP,' for 1 = 1,2,3,. . .,L for L draws from the posterior distribution. To perform simulations, we first draw values for Or''".' from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters x, y, l and then draw yr'P,' from the multinomial likelihood function, Equation 1 1 . With the y r p P in hand, we can evaluate our models with the calculation of p-values within the Bayesian statistics framework. Because Bayesian inference is performed over the entire posterior distribution of the parameters, rather than just a point value as in classical statistics, we calculate the proportion of simulation draws where the replicated data are more extreme than the experimental data,

Bayesian statistics of protein side chains K is a scale factorthat affects the influence of the prior distribution on the posterior distribution by setting the value of x0 in Equation 12 proportional to the number of side chains yo in the experimental data with rl = i. For larger values of K,the prior distribution exerts a stronger pull on the experimental data. Because some of the rotamer types are not seen at all in the limited data set, we would like some estimate of their probability, beyond the crudenoninformative distribution result. Higher values of K are therefore desirable. We do not know for sure how good our prior distribution is and the resulting posterior distribution (which is the goal) is dependent on it. So we test the posterior distributions using the Bayesian version of the x 2 test by simulating draws, @rep, from the posterior distributions from a range of values for K and y from the likelihood functions. The resulting p-values indicate what fraction of the sample draws yielded a value of the test x function that were larger than the value for the actual data sample. Values near 1/2 indicate that the experimental data are exactly in the middle of the posterior distribution. Values below 0.05 and above 0.95 indicate that the data do not appear to come from the posterior distribution. We divided the data in half and derived backbone-independent rotamer libraries from each half database as well as the full database. For values of K 5 0.5, when the data and posterior distribution come from the same data set, the p-values stay within the range 0.4-0.7. Using as large a value of K as possible allows us to emphasize the prior distribution in cases where N is small. When either half database was used for the posterior distribution and the full database was used as the data, the range of p-values was lower, but they increased to more median levels as K was increased. This indicates that, for situations with less experimental data (the half databases), the posterior distribution should rely heavily on an informative prior distribution. We found a value of K = 0.5 to be optimal. This is a useful guideline for the more complicated case of the backbone-dependent distributions, where there is much less data per parameter than in the backbone-independent case. Backbone-dependent rotamer library We would like to determine a backbone-dependent library that is continuousover the full Ramachandran map and that provides good estimates for regions that are only weakly populated or even unpopulated in the PDB. We can check the model in various ways to ensure that the populated regions are represented accurately. In our prior distribution, we postulate that

To test how well the posterior distributions represent the data in the occupied regions of the Ramachandran map, we calculated the p-values for the distributions for all side chains with the results listed in Table 6.

This is an overdetermined problem, because there are 36 X 36 values on theleft-hand side to be expressed as a linear combination of 72 values on the right-hand side. The matrix equation can be solved by singular value decomposition (SVD), and is guaranteed to be the best solution of the overdetermined problem in the leastsquares sense (Press et al., 1988).

from a Bayesian analysis using a normal model for both the priorand posterior distributions. We are looking for average x angles as a function of 4 and for all rotamer combinations, e.g., for Lys, values for X I, z 2 , z 3 , j 4 ~ $ ~ , + b ,r2,r3,r4, There is not sufficient information in the PDB r~, to determine this many parameters, so we determine only a subset of these values, assuming, for instance, that X 3 and j 3 are independent of 4 and +. In Table 7, we list the parameters that were used in theprior and posterior distributions for the x angle averages. Generally, we expect that each x angle's distribution is affected only by its rotameric state and the dihedral or rotameric state on either side. This is reflected in the choice of prior distribution dependencies. Some non-neighboring dependencies are included in the posterior distributions, in case they are of some relevance in the data analysis.

The assumption that dihedral averages depend only on the neighboring rotameric states can be tested by calculating test statistics as described above. It should be noted that ujara the variance in is &, the x angle experimental data, whereas a , is the variance in the mean of the x angle, i.e., an expression of our uncertainty in the mean value, not the variance in the data from an infinitely large PDB. Molecular mechanics calculations We have used the program C H A R " (Brooks et al., 1983) to calculate the energies of side-chain rotamers in both the backboneindependent and backbone-dependent contexts. For all of these calculations, we have used the C H A R " 2 2 potential energy function, which includes all atoms (polar and nonpolar hydrogens) and which has been optimized to represent a variety of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in proteins. The backbone-independent energies were calculated by considering the atoms in a single residue fragment consisting of only N, Ccr, Hcr, C, and the residue side-chain. Backbone-dependent rotamer preferences were calculated with unconstrained x I (and x2)dihedrals starting from near the likely minima (60", 180", -60") by fixing the 4 and # dihedrals of the N-acetyl N'-methylamide of each amino acid with force constants of 1,000 kcal/mol and minimizing with 1,000 steps of the conjugate gradient minimizer. We placed an oxygen atom bonded to NH of each dipeptide in the position of a likely hydrogen bond acceptor. The oxygen was fixed at a distance of 3.0 8, from the backbone N and collinear with the NH bond. The dielectric constant E was set to 1.0. In most cases, the minimized x1values were less than 35" from the starting conformations. In others, no local minimum value was over 100" from the original was found and the final value. If the minimized dihedral angle value was more than 60" away from the initial value, a force constant of 100 kcal/mol was applied to the x dihedrals at their initial values, and the minimization was repeated. This ensures that the rotamer energies (after excluding the constraint energies) and calculated probabilities correspond to the correct rotamers. To remove the influence of the backbone-backbone steric interactions and to plot the database energies and CHARMM energies, ,!$(4a$b), in a similar way, we invert the Boltzmann calculation,

Pro

For each term in the prior distributions, we use a normal distribution by calculating a mean and variance of the x angle from side chains in the database with the given values of 4, #, rl , etc. If we have two different prior distributions for a parameter, p l ( 0 ) and p2(0),we can estimate the joint prior distribution as their product, p ( 0 ) pl(0)p2(0).So for instance, in combining the and $ dependencies for Cys, Ser, Val, and Thr,
